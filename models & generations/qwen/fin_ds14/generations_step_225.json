    "response": "What is sleep paralysis? Sleep paralysis is a condition in which a person wakes up but cannot move or speak for several seconds to minutes after falling asleep. It is also called \"hypnagogic arousal.\" Sleep paralysis may occur on its own or be part of a sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy. What are the symptoms of sleep paralysis? The most common symptom of sleep paralysis is being unable to move or speak for several seconds to minutes after falling asleep.

    "question": "Why do helicopter blades make the choppy sound they do when they are spinning around at a constant speed ? If they are turning at the same rate , should n't they just make sort of a buzzing sound and not a pulsing sound ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The sound of helicopter rotors is made up of two types of sounds: one from the air being cut by the rotor blades and one from the air being sucked into the rotor. The air that is being cut by the rotor blades makes a whistling sound. This sound is the same as the sound you hear when you blow across the top of a bottle. When the rotor blade cuts through the air, it creates a shock wave. The shock wave is a pressure wave that travels outward from the rotor blade. It can be heard as a whistle. The air that is sucked into the rotor creates a different type of sound. This sound is similar to the sound you hear when you suck on a straw. When the rotor blade sucks in air, it creates a vacuum. A vacuum is an area with very low pressure. The air outside the rotor blade rushes into the rotor blade to fill the vacuum. As the air rushes into the rotor blade, it causes the blade to vibrate. The vibration creates another type of sound. This type of sound is called a \"buzz.\" The buzz is the same sound you hear when you tap a spoon against a bowl. The sound of the rotor blade cutting through the air and sucking in air is combined to make the helicopter's unique sound. The whistling sound and the buzzing sound both change depending on how fast the rotor blade is spinning. If the rotor blade spins very slowly, the whistling sound will be higher pitched. If the rotor blade spins very quickly, the whistling sound will be lower pitched. The buzz will also change depending on how fast the rotor blade is spinning. If the rotor blade spins very slowly, the buzz will be lower pitched. If the rotor blade spins very quickly, the buzz will be higher pitched."

    "response": "The police can't catch all the bad guys who commit crimes, so many don't get caught at all. That's why we know how many crimes there are in our community. The police estimate how many crimes there are by asking people if they've been victimized. We call this a \"survey.\" The survey asks people if they've experienced a crime during the past year and, if so, what kind of crime it was. The police also ask how many crimes people think went unreported. For example, they may ask, \"How many robberies did you think went unreported last year?\" People who answer the survey tell the police how many crimes they think went unreported. Then the police use the information to estimate the total number of crimes that happened. The police then use this information to make decisions about how much money to spend on police protection.

    "question": "Why do we generally perceive people who are overweight as \" less attractive \" than people who are slim ? Just curious as to why people generally perceive people who are overweight as unattractive while we see people who are slim as being attractive or good - looking . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "It's hard to say exactly why we think overweight people look less attractive. One theory is that the fat we carry on our bodies may affect our health in ways that make us look less healthy. For example, extra weight can raise blood pressure and cholesterol levels. People with high blood pressure and cholesterol have higher risk of heart disease and stroke. If they develop these diseases, their hearts will not pump enough blood to the body, and their skin will not get enough oxygen. These conditions can cause dark circles under the eyes and other signs of fatigue. Other factors also contribute to how overweight people look. Fat around the waist (called visceral fat) is associated with more serious health problems than fat stored in other parts of the body. Visceral fat increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions. A person who carries excess weight around his or her middle has a higher risk of developing these conditions. When you're overweight, you might look tired even when you're well rested because your body has to work harder to function. The extra effort required to move and breathe can leave you feeling fatigued. This can affect how you look and feel. In addition, some people gain weight as they age, which can change the way they look. It's also important to remember that being overweight isn't always about food and eating too much. Sometimes it's about having a condition that causes you to gain weight. For example, polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition among women that causes weight gain and other symptoms. Being overweight can be a sign of an underlying medical problem. If you think you might be overweight, talk to your doctor. He or she can help you find out whether your weight is a sign of a medical problem."

    "question": "Why do taxpayers front the bill for sports stadiums ? Should n't that be a business 's ( NFL ) responsibility ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "It's not really the taxpayers' money. The tax dollars come from the people who pay their property taxes to support the schools and other public services that make the city or state attractive to the team owners. If the team owners decide to build a stadium on their own, they'll have to find private investors to finance it. The investors will charge interest on the loans they take out to pay for the project. That means the team owners will be paying interest on top of the cost of building the stadium. Plus, the investors will want a piece of the action in the form of a profit when the stadium is finished. They'll get their cut from the ticket sales, concessions, parking fees, and other sources of revenue. In fact, the investors may end up paying for the stadium themselves if the team owners can't come up with enough money to build it. And there's no guarantee that the team owners will ever make back the money they invested. If the stadium doesn't bring in enough money to cover its costs, the investors will lose money. In other words, the team owners would be using public money to make a private investment. It's just not fair to ask taxpayers to pay for something that benefits only the team owners. If the team owners don't want to build a new stadium, they should just move somewhere else. It's their choice, but taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for it. - The National League of Cities, \"What Is Public-Private Partnership?\" - National League of Cities, \"Stadiums: A Primer,\" 2001. - National League of Cities, \"Public-Private Partnerships and Stadiums: A Guide for Local Officials,\" 2005. - The Sports Council, \"The Business Case for Sport: A Review of the Economic Benefits of Sport and Sport Venues,\" 2006. - The Sports Council, \"Stadiums: The Business Case,\" 2007. - The Sports Council, \"The Business Case for Sport Venues,\" 2009."

    "question": "Why do n't professional basketball players backboard alley - oop to themselves in - game more ? Specifically in the half - court : URL_0 EDIT : Clarification Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Professional basketball players don't backboard alley-oop to themselves because it is very difficult to do so and they are not required to do so in order to win a game. Backboard alley-oops are very hard to do because you have to be able to jump high enough to reach the backboard without jumping too high or too low. It's also important to catch the ball with your hands while in midair. If you catch the ball with your hands before you reach the backboard, you will not be able to catch it after you hit the backboard. Also, you must be able to throw the ball into the basket while you are still in the air. The difficulty of this play makes it unlikely that a player would want to practice doing it over and over again in order to get better at it. Even if a player wanted to practice doing it, there are no rules requiring them to do so in order to win a game. Therefore, they don't do it. Backboard alley-oops are not required to win a game because winning a game depends on scoring points. Points can be scored by shooting the ball through the basket. A player can score points even if he does not make a backboard alley-oo. Backboard alley-oops are not required to win a game because there is no rule stating that a player must attempt one. Players can choose whether or not to attempt one. They may choose not to attempt one because they do not feel comfortable doing so or they believe that they will not be successful at doing so. They may also choose not to attempt one because they think that they should focus on other aspects of the game, such as shooting the ball from the free-throw line or driving to the basket."

    "question": "What happens in the brain of a schizophrenic ? How is it different to a \" normal \" brain ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The Human Brain The human brain is made up of many parts. The brain controls all of your body's functions. It also helps you think and learn. There are two sides to the brain: the right side and the left side. These sides work together to help you see, hear, speak, read, write, and do other tasks. Your brain has three main parts: 1) the cerebrum (suh-RE-brum), which is on top and makes up most of the brain; 2) the cerebellum (suh-re-bull-lum), which is at the back of the brain; and 3) the brain stem, which connects the cerebrum and the cerebellum to the spinal cord. The cerebrum controls thoughts, speech, and movement. It also controls your senses, such as seeing and hearing. The cerebellum controls balance and coordination. It also helps control movement and posture. The brain stem controls breathing, blood pressure, and heartbeat. The brain stem also sends messages between the brain and the rest of the body. The Cerebrum The cerebrum is divided into two halves called hemispheres (HEE-mi-seh-pi-ahz). The right hemisphere controls the left side of the body. The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body. Each hemisphere has four lobes: 1) the frontal lobe (FRON-tul LO-bee), which sits in front of the cerebellum; 2) the parietal lobe (PAIR-ee-TAL lo-bee), which is near the middle of the cerebrum; 3) the temporal lobe (TEM-pur-al LO-bee), which is near the back of the cerebrum; and 4) the occipital (OKS-ip-uh-tl) lobe, which is at the very back of the cerebrum. The frontal lobes help with thinking, planning, and understanding. The parietal lobes help with touch, smell, and temperature. The temporal lobes help with memory, learning, and understanding language. The occipital lobes help with vision. The Cerebellum The cerebellum is located at the back of the brain. It is shaped like a small bowl. The cerebellum helps control muscle movements and helps coordinate and direct movement. It also helps control balance and posture.

    "response": "The Romans and Greeks did not have the same idea about what was \"beautiful\" as we do today. They thought that a woman's body should be proportionate, not too big or small. They also believed that men should look strong and powerful. This is why many of their sculptures show women with smaller breasts, hips, and thighs. Men were shown with smaller penises. The Greeks and Romans thought that a large penis would make a man look fat and ugly. So they made them look small.

    "question": "How does a measurement device use significant figures to measure something ? It ’s my first week in chemistry class for my next degree and my nursing - oriented brain is already struggling . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The image above shows an example of a measurement device using significant figures to measure something. Measurement devices use the concept of significant figures to make their measurements as accurate as possible. When measuring with a ruler or meter stick, you should always round your measurement to one more decimal place than the smallest unit that is used on the ruler. For example, if you are using a ruler with millimeters (mm), you would round your measurement to the nearest 0.1 mm (or 0.1 cm). If you are using a meter stick with centimeters (cm), you would round your measurement to the nearest 0.1 cm (or 1 mm). If you are using a meter stick with meters (m), you would round your measurement to the nearest 0.1 m (or 10 mm). Rounding to one more decimal place than the smallest unit on the ruler allows you to take advantage of all of the information provided by the ruler without having to waste any of it. If you were to round your measurement to the same number of decimal places as the smallest unit on the ruler, you would be losing information. This would result in an inaccurate measurement. For example, if you were using a meter stick with meters (m), you could round your measurement to the nearest 0.1 m (or 10 mm). However, if you were to round your measurement to the same number of decimal places as the smallest unit on the ruler (to the nearest 10 mm), you would lose all of the information provided by the meter stick. This would result in an inaccurate measurement. Once you have rounded your measurement, you can record it using the appropriate number of significant figures. For example, if you measured an object with a ruler and rounded your measurement to the nearest 0.1 m (or 10 mm), you would record your measurement as 2.3 m (or 230 mm). If you measured an object with a meter stick and rounded your measurement to the nearest 10 mm, you would record your measurement as 560 mm. The important thing to remember when using significant figures is that you should only use them when you are recording your measurement. You should not use them when you are actually taking the measurement."

    "response": "The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the body. It has four chambers: two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. Atria ventricles The heart's job is to keep oxygen-rich blood flowing from the lungs to the rest of the body. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the right atrium (AR-tee-um) through the superior vena cava (VEN-us KAY-va), a large vein. From the right atrium, the blood flows into the right ventricle (VEN-trih-kul). The right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) valve to the lungs. The blood picks up oxygen there. Then it returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. From the left atrium, the blood flows into the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta (AOR-ah-ta). The aorta is the largest artery in the body. The heart is also controlled by electrical signals. These signals cause the heart to beat in a regular rhythm. The heart has two separate electrical pathways. One pathway controls the heartbeat. The other helps the heart relax between beats.

Well, for one thing, if you coated the outside of a car with a paint-like substance that was supposed to keep it from rusting, then the paint would chip off and peel away. Then it wouldn't be very pretty. Also, if you coated the outside of a car with a paint-like substance that was supposed to keep it from rusting, then it would be hard to clean the car without damaging the coating. So you couldn't wash it, dry it, wax it, or polish it. And if you did all those things, you'd probably damage the coating. And if you damaged the coating, it might rust anyway. So you wouldn't get any benefit from the coating. If you coated the inside of a car with a paint-like substance that was supposed to keep it from rusting, then the paint would stick to the metal.

    "response": "A one-way mirror is a pane of glass that allows light to pass in only one direction. Light from the outside cannot pass through and shine on the person inside the room. This means that someone inside the room can see outside, but people outside cannot see inside. A one-way mirror is made of two pieces of glass with a special coating between them. The coating causes the glass to reflect some of the light. The light reflects off the coating and back into the room. The reflection is very small, but enough to make it hard for someone outside the room to see through the glass. A one-way mirror is used in many situations where you want to watch what is going on outside without being seen. Police officers use one-way mirrors to look out windows or doorways without being seen by people inside buildings. In addition, they can see if anyone leaves or enters the building. Security guards may use one-way mirrors to watch over parking lots and other areas. One-way mirrors are also used in laboratories and hospitals. For example, doctors may use one-way mirrors to watch patients during surgery without being seen by the patient. This helps keep the patient calm. In the past, one-way mirrors were expensive and hard to find. However, today they are much more common and less expensive. You can even buy one-way mirrors at home improvement stores."

The testes produce sperm and testosterone. The epididymis stores and transports sperm. The vas deferens carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. The seminal vesicles produce fluid that nourishes and protects sperm cells. The prostate gland produces fluid that mixes with sperm from the seminal vesicles to form semen. The penis is the external organ of sexual reproduction. (This article was written by a health care professional.)"

    "question": "How do we know what dead languages ( Latin , Ancient Greek , etc ) sounded like ? How do we know the pronunciation of these languages when they 've been dead for 100s of years and there 's no audio records of them being spoken ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "We know the pronunciation of dead languages because scholars have spent thousands of hours transcribing the surviving written texts of those languages. In the case of Latin, it was taught as part of the classical education system in the Western world until well into the 20th century, so many people were able to read Latin and speak it at least to some degree. For example, you can hear the Latin of Cicero in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x8J7w6zXZk The surviving texts of Ancient Greek are much more limited than those of Latin, but there are still a lot of them. Here is an example of the ancient Greek language being spoken: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvWf4tVcQ5U The pronunciation of these languages has changed over time, but we can use our knowledge of how languages change to reconstruct how the original sounds of these languages would have sounded. We can also compare the surviving texts with modern spoken versions of these languages to get a better idea of how they were pronounced. For example, we can look at the way that English words are pronounced today and compare that to the way they were pronounced in Ancient Greek and Latin. This helps us figure out how the letters in those languages would have been pronounced. We can also compare the surviving texts of Ancient Greek and Latin to modern spoken versions of those languages to get a better idea of how they were pronounced. This helps us figure out how the letters in those languages would have been pronounced. So, even though we don't have recordings of people speaking Latin or Ancient Greek, we can still reconstruct their pronunciation based on the surviving texts and modern spoken versions of the languages."

    "response": "The Theory of Relativity was developed by Albert Einstein. Einstein developed two theories of relativity: Special Relativity and General Relativity. Special Relativity was published in 1905. General Relativity was published in 1916. Special Relativity was based on the postulate that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers. In other words, the laws of physics do not change from one observer to another unless they are accelerating. General Relativity is based on the postulate that the laws of physics are the same for all observers. It also includes the postulate that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the light source.

    "response": "Here is a summary of Wiles' proof. The first step was to prove a special case of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for semistable elliptic curves. This was done in 1986 by Ken Ribet. Ribet's proof showed that if a semistable elliptic curve has complex multiplication and does not have a rational point of small prime order, then the associated L-function vanishes at s = 1. In 1987, Andrew Wiles proved the full Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for semistable elliptic curves without complex multiplication. He did this by proving a result known as modularity lifting. He also proved the main technical result needed to reduce the general case to the semistable case. Then, using a special case of the modularity theorem for elliptic curves, Wiles was able to show that there are no nontrivial solutions to the equation x + y + z = 0 with x, y, and z all cubes of rational numbers. Thus, Fermat's Last Theorem follows from the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture."

    "question": "How are there places where the desert meets the ocean , like in Saudi Arabia ? I do n't understand how you can have a dry sandy landscape right next to an ocean and not have any precipitation and vegetation . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Hi! You're right that it's hard to imagine how a place could be so dry next to an ocean. But the land around the Persian Gulf has lots of water - just not on the surface. The Persian Gulf is surrounded by huge amounts of water deep underground. This water is called groundwater. It gets into the ground through cracks in the rock below. Groundwater is stored underground in underground aquifers. An aquifer is a layer of porous rock or sand through which water moves. Groundwater is very important because it fills the wells and springs that supply people with fresh water. In some places, the water in the aquifer comes close to the surface. When this happens, we call the area a \"spring\" or a \"fountain.\" Springs can be found all over the Persian Gulf region. In some areas, the water rises up out of the ground. This is called a \"gusher.\" In other areas, the water is too far down for us to reach it easily. In these cases, we use special machines to bring the water up from the aquifer. These machines are called \"drillers.\" The drillers can bring water up from deep underground. The water comes out at a high pressure. This is called \"oil and gas drilling.\" Sometimes, when oil and gas are being drilled, we find the water too. If we do, we call it \"brine.\" Brine is salty water. It's much saltier than seawater. Brine is used to make things like soap and glass. In other parts of the world, brine is used to make salt. Salt is used to preserve foods and keep food fresh. It's also used to clean things. Some places have both brine and oil and gas. For example, Saudi Arabia. The desert sands of the Arabian Peninsula are made of tiny grains of rock. As rain falls on the mountains, it seeps down through the soil. It collects in the cracks between the rocks. Over time, the water becomes salty. It then flows down into the aquifer. When the water reaches the Persian Gulf, it evaporates. This creates clouds of vapor. These clouds form rain. So, even though there's no rain falling on the desert, there's still rain. The rain that falls on the mountains mixes with the rain that falls on the coast. Together, they form a big cloud system that brings rain to the Persian Gulf region."

    "question": "Why do diabetics have to be so careful with their feet ? Thank you all for your explanations ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "diabetes can damage the nerves of the feet and lower legs. This condition is called diabetic neuropathy. The damaged nerves cause numbness, tingling, or pain in the toes, arches, and heels. Because there is no pain, people may not know they have neuropathy until serious problems occur. Diabetic neuropathy also can affect the autonomic nerves, which control involuntary body functions such as digestion and blood pressure. It also can cause slow healing or even lack of feeling in the feet and lower legs. Without these sensations, injuries may go unnoticed and worsen. For example, cuts or blisters may develop on the feet without being noticed. This can lead to infections and ulcers. If the infections get worse, gangrene may result. Gangrene is tissue death caused by lack of oxygen. It requires immediate medical care. Without treatment, it can lead to amputation. Diabetes also can harm the blood vessels in the feet and legs. This condition is called peripheral vascular disease. Peripheral vascular disease can reduce blood flow to the lower limbs, causing coldness, numbness, and pain. This condition can lead to serious problems if the person doesn't receive treatment. For example, wounds that take longer to heal can become infected. Also, gangrene can occur more easily. Prevention and Treatment Prevention and treatment of diabetes can help prevent foot problems. People should take good care of their feet every day. They should wear comfortable shoes and socks and check their feet daily for any injuries or sores. If they notice any, they should treat them right away. Also, they should see their health care provider regularly to check for and treat foot problems. People who have diabetes should avoid wearing tight-fitting shoes and socks because they can cause pressure sores. Tight-fitting shoes and socks can irritate the skin and cause blisters. They also can trap sweat and heat against the skin. This can make sores worse. Also, tight-fitting shoes and socks can rub on the skin and cause sores. The best way to prevent foot problems is to follow your health care provider's advice about controlling your blood glucose level and taking good care of your feet. This includes wearing proper fitting shoes and socks and checking your feet every day for injuries or sores. If you have diabetes, always talk with your health care provider before treating any injuries or sores. If you have diabetes and have had a foot injury, infection, or ulcer for more than 3 days, you should call your health care provider right away. For more information about foot"

    "question": "What are the precautions to be taken before having polio vaccine?I have dermatomyositis and my baby grand-daughter is about to have her vaccinations which include the oral polio vaccine.  As this is a live vaccine, what precautions should I take as we are meant to avoid contact with people who have just received live vaccines?    Thank you.  Sarah",
    "response": "The live oral polio vaccine (OPV) is not used in the United States because of the risk of contracting vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). However, OPV is still used in other parts of the world. If you or your child have received OPV, it is important to avoid close contact with others who have received OPV for at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Close contact includes kissing, hugging, handshaking, sharing food, drinks, eating utensils, and toys. You can help prevent VAPP by following these guidelines: - Avoid close contact with anyone who has received OPV. - Do not allow your infant to suck on your pacifier, bottle, or any object that has been in your mouth. - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after handling objects or surfaces that may have been contaminated by OPV. - Do not let your infant eat food prepared by someone who has received OPV. - If you are traveling outside the United States, consult with your health care provider about whether you need to avoid close contact with people who have received OPV. The best way to protect yourself from polio is to make sure that you are fully vaccinated against the disease. Vaccination will also help protect you from getting sick if you come into contact with poliovirus. For more information, go to http://www.cdc.gov/pcr."

    "question": "What is the difference between 1080i and 1080p ? I 've been looking at TV 's recently , and noticed 1080p and 1080i , what exactly is the difference ? Which is better ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The \"i\" in 1080i stands for interlaced. The \"p\" in 1080p stands for progressive scan. Both 1080i and 1080p use the same 1,080-line resolution that makes high-definition images sharp and clear. But there's a key difference between these two formats. In 1080i, video images are displayed in two fields per frame: odd-numbered lines of each image are displayed first, followed by even-numbered lines. This creates an effect called \"flicker,\" which can be annoying to some viewers. In 1080p, video images are displayed as one complete frame at a time. This eliminates flicker. 1080i and 1080p both have the same 1,080 horizontal lines of resolution. But 1080i has twice the number of vertical lines of resolution (540) compared with 1080p (296). 1080i provides more horizontal resolution than 1080p, but 1080p provides more vertical resolution. 1080i and 1080p are both compatible with existing HDTV technology. 1080p is the format used in all HDTV camcorders and DVD players. 1080i is the format used in all HDTV TVs and VCRs. The new high-definition TV standard, HDTV, uses 1080i or 1080p. If you want the best possible picture quality, buy an HDTV that supports 1080p. 1080p is the future of television."

    "question": "The relation of the moon to the tides system How does the moon affect the tides , and how do tides work ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "shows that the Moon's gravity pulls on Earth's oceans and causes tides. The Moon is about 380,000 kilometers away from the Earth. The Moon's gravitational pull creates the tides because it is much closer to the Earth than the Sun. It is also much smaller than the Earth. This means that the Moon has more of an effect on the tides than the Sun. This is why we have two high tides and two low tides every day, and not one high tide and one low tide. It also helps to explain why the Moon is the only celestial body that we can see from the Earth. It is also why the Moon is called the \"wonderful\" Moon.

    "response": "An embryo grows inside an egg and gets bigger and bigger. As the embryo grows, its body parts get bigger too. When the embryo is ready to come out of the egg, its body parts have grown big enough that it can break through the shell and come out. The embryo doesn't just grow until it's ready to come out of the egg. It needs a signal from the outside world to tell it when it's time to come out. That signal comes from hormones. Hormones are chemicals that carry messages between cells. In chickens, the hormone called prostaglandin F2 alpha tells the chick to break through the eggshell."

The subreddit /r / Trees was set up to raise money to plant 1 million trees in the United States. This is an important thing to do because trees help clean the air, prevent soil erosion, and provide habitat for wildlife. So far, they've raised over $500,000. That's a lot of money! But then, a user named \"TheLynx\" posted a message saying that he had been paid $2,000 by a company called \"Trees for the Future\" to write a post about their work with trees. TheLynx said that the money should be given to Trees for the Future instead of /r / Trees. Many people got upset because they thought this money should have gone to /r / Trees. Other users said that TheLynx had been paid to say bad things about /r / Trees. Still other users said that they were happy to hear that the money would be used for planting trees, but that TheLynx shouldn't have been paid to say anything about Trees for the Future. Reddit is trying to figure out what to do with this money. Some people think it should be given to /r / Trees. Others think it should be given to Trees for the Future. And still others think it should be given to another organization that plants trees. Reddit is still looking at the situation.

    "response": "People who have heart disease should not overexert themselves when the air quality is poor. Overexertion can cause their hearts to work harder and raise their blood pressure and heart rate.

The air quality index (AQI) is a tool used to measure the levels of pollutants in the air. The AQI is a color-coded system. When the AQI for a pollutant reaches 150 or higher, the air is considered unhealthy, especially for people with heart and lung disease. When the AQI for a pollutant reaches 200 or higher, the air is considered very unhealthy, especially for people with heart and lung disease. If you have a heart condition, it's important to check the AQI for your area before you go outside. If the air quality is unhealthy or very unhealthy, try to stay indoors as much as possible.

    "response": "s are designed to save energy and water by using cold water for regular loads. If you're concerned about saving energy, consider using the warm setting for heavily soiled clothing or items with stains. If you're concerned about shrinking, try setting your machine to use only a little bit of water and using a small load. Another way to save water is to run your machine only when you have a full load of laundry. If you don't have enough clothes to fill the machine, use the empty washer to clean out any detergent or fabric softener residue that may be left in the tub. Some people also use the rinse cycle as a way to save water. The rinse cycle uses less water than the spin cycle, which is why it's important to make sure that all of the clothes are fully dry before you turn off the machine. This will help to prevent wrinkles and keep the clothes looking fresh longer. If you're concerned about shrinking, try using the machine's spin cycle to remove excess moisture from the clothes before they're completely dry. This will help to reduce the amount of time that the clothes spend in the dryer, which will save energy and reduce wear and tear on the machine.

    "response": "The device is called a \"ringtone generator.\" It's used to make a ringing sound. The sound is produced by an electronic circuit that generates an alternating current. This current is sent through an electromagnet inside the device. The electromagnet creates a magnetic field around the coil of wire. This magnetic field causes a small metal rod to vibrate back and forth inside the device. The vibration of the rod produces sound waves that travel through the air and into your ear canal. The vibrations cause your eardrum to move. Your brain interprets these vibrations as sound."

    "question": "What is the environmental argument against wind power ? I know some environmentalists oppose wind power , and wondered what the reasons are . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Wind energy is an alternative energy source that is very clean and has virtually no impact on the environment. In fact, wind energy can be produced without using any water or chemicals, and it doesn't produce any greenhouse gases. Wind energy is also very reliable, because the wind blows consistently throughout the day and night. However, there are some concerns about wind energy, such as its potential to harm birds and bats. The wind turbine blades can kill birds and bats if they fly into them. Also, wind turbines can interfere with radar systems used for air traffic control. However, these problems can be solved by designing the wind turbines in a way that minimizes their impact on wildlife and radar systems. In addition, wind energy can cause visual pollution, which can be a problem for people who live near wind farms. However, this problem can also be solved by designing the wind turbines in a way that minimizes their visual impact. In summary, wind energy is a very clean and reliable energy source that can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and other nonrenewable energy sources. It is important to continue to research and develop new technologies that will make wind energy even more efficient and cost-effective."

    "question": "Why are some bullets described as calibre ( 50.cal ) and others described as in mm ( 9 mm ) ? are these descriptions able to be interchanged ? like what would be the calibre of a 9 mm round shot from a M9 ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Calibres and bore diameters are measured in millimeters. Calibres are expressed as whole numbers and are rounded to the nearest half-inch. For example, a 7.62x39mm is approximately .30 caliber. The .30 caliber is the number that is used to describe this calibre. A 9mm bullet is a 9 millimeter bullet. A 50 caliber is a 50 millimeter bullet. So, a 9mm bullet has a diameter of 9mm and a 50 caliber has a diameter of 50mm. When a gun fires a bullet, it pushes the bullet forward with a certain amount of force. This force is called the muzzle velocity. A bullet with a higher muzzle velocity will travel further than a bullet with a lower muzzle velocity. In general, the larger the bullet the greater its muzzle velocity. Some guns can fire different types of bullets. A 9mm pistol may be capable of firing 9mm bullets or .38 caliber bullets. A .38 caliber bullet is smaller than a 9mm bullet. A .38 caliber bullet will have less mass than a 9mm bullet. This means that the .38 caliber bullet will have less momentum. Momentum is the product of an objects mass and its velocity. Less momentum means that the .38 caliber bullet will travel a shorter distance than the 9mm bullet. A 50 caliber bullet fired from a 50 caliber rifle will travel farther than a 9mm bullet fired from a 9mm pistol. This is because the 50 caliber bullet has more mass and momentum than the 9mm bullet. The same bullet can have a different calibre depending on how it is used. A bullet that is loaded into a handgun will have a calibre equal to the bore diameter of the gun. A bullet that is loaded into a rifle will have a calibre equal to the bore diameter of the rifle."

    "response": "(a procedure in which an catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and advanced to the site of interest) and angiograms are usually done with x ray imaging (the x ray machine is used to visualize the anatomy of the blood vessels). angiograms are done in a hospital or outpatient center. if you have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood-thinning medication, you may need to stop taking these medications before the procedure. you should also let your doctor know if you have any allergies or medical conditions. the procedure typically takes about 30 minutes. during the procedure, a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel, usually in the groin, arm, or neck. the catheter is then advanced to the area of interest using x-ray guidance. once the catheter is in place, a contrast dye is injected into the bloodstream. as the contrast dye moves through the blood vessels, it creates images that can be viewed on a computer screen or film. the images help doctors see the size, shape, and location of the blood vessels. after the procedure, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight or go home the same day. you may need to take blood-thinning medication after the procedure to prevent blood clots from forming in the catheter or blood vessel. complications can include bleeding, infection, and damage to the blood vessel or surrounding tissue. however, the benefits of angiography often outweigh the risks. if you have questions about your procedure, talk to your doctor. they will be able to answer your questions and help you understand what to expect. was this answer helpful?"

    "question": "What causes recurring throbbing pain in wrists?I have been getting an on and off severe throbbing pain in my wrists (usually right but sometimes left) and it feels like the pain is in my veins. It has been happening multiple times a day lately but used to come and go over a few days. What is this?",
    "response": "There are many possible causes of wrist pain, including: Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Gout Carpal tunnel syndrome Ganglion cysts Broken bone Tumors or cancer Infections Infection from a cut or wound A pinched nerve A sprain or strain A broken bone Tendonitis (inflammation of a tendon) Cysts (fluid-filled sacs) A pinched nerve - This occurs when a nerve is compressed or squeezed as it passes through an area of the body. The most common places for a pinched nerve are the neck, back, and wrist. A pinched nerve can cause numbness, weakness, tingling, and/or pain. - Carpal tunnel syndrome - This condition occurs when a nerve that runs from your forearm to your hand becomes irritated and swollen. It can cause numbness, tingling, and pain in your hand and fingers. - Gout - This is a type of arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. The big toe is the most common site for gout, but the wrist and hand may also be affected. Symptoms include intense pain, swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. - Osteoarthritis - This is a disease that slowly destroys the cartilage between the bones in your hands. Cartilage provides cushioning between the bones in your joints. As cartilage wears away, the bones rub together. Osteoarthritis often causes joint pain and stiffness. The wrist is one of the most commonly affected areas. - Rheumatoid arthritis - This is a chronic disease that causes joint inflammation and pain. It usually affects the smaller joints in the hands and feet first. The wrist is a common site for rheumatoid arthritis. - Tendonitis - This is inflammation of a tendon. Tendons are cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Tendonitis usually results from overuse or repetitive motion. - Ganglion cysts - These are benign tumors that form on tendons or ligaments. They are usually not painful unless they press on nearby nerves. The wrist is a common place for a ganglion cyst to form. - Broken bone - A broken bone in the wrist can occur if you fall onto an outstretched hand. Broken bones are called fractures. Broken bones can be treated with surgery, casts, splints, or braces. - Tumors or cancer - These are abnormal growths that can develop in the wrist. - Infection - An infection can occur in the wrist after a cut"

    "question": "Why do we use deodorant ? Pretty much every other species on this planet that produces a natural smell uses that smell to attract a mate . Why do we humans feel that our natural smell is bad and needs to be covered up ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "odor . Humans can smell 10,000 times better than most animals. This ability makes us more sensitive to the scent of sweat. Sweat glands secrete sweat from the skin. Sweat glands produce sweat, which contains salt and urea. Urea is a waste product of protein metabolism. When you exercise, your body temperature rises. As your body temperature rises, the sweat glands release sweat. The sweat evaporates, cooling your body. Sweating also helps to keep your body temperature constant.

    "response": "The amount of time your urine stream lasts depends on how much urine is in your bladder when you begin to urinate. A large bladder causes the stream to last longer than a small bladder. The length of your stream also depends on whether you're sitting or standing while you urinate. If you're sitting, your stream will be shorter than if you're standing. The stream may also be shorter if you're wearing tight underwear. Some people can't control the stream length. This problem is called dribbling. Dribbling doesn't mean you need to urinate. It's a normal part of urination that occurs when you've emptied your bladder but haven't yet finished urinating. If you have trouble controlling the stream length, you should talk with your doctor. He or she may suggest certain exercises or medicines. Dribbling isn't a sign of a serious health problem. If you have a problem with dribbling, your doctor can help you find a solution."

    "response": "asphalt pavement in Los Angeles. Asphalt is made from crude oil. When you think about it, all petroleum products are black because they are made from carbon. Carbon is a black element. Carbon is also found in coal and charcoal. Coal and charcoal are used to make iron and steel. Iron and steel are used to make buildings and bridges. So, if you look at the history of civilization, you will see that black materials were used for many things. Asphalt is used to make roads and parking lots. Asphalt is made from crude oil. Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons can be straight chains of carbon atoms, branched chains of carbon atoms, or rings of carbon atoms. When these hydrocarbons are heated, the straight chains and branched chains break apart. The rings of carbon don't break apart. When the straight chains and branched chains break apart, they form shorter molecules. These shorter molecules are called alkanes. Alkanes are hydrocarbons with only single bonds between carbon atoms. When the alkanes are heated even more, they break apart into smaller pieces. The smallest pieces are called alkane molecules.

    "question": "Why do people react to someone else vomiting by vomiting themselves ? Why do we involuntarily react that way ? Just watching someone vomit causes a large part of the population to puke themselves as in a chain reaction . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Your brain has two systems for sensing things: one system is voluntary and you can control it; the other system is involuntary and you cannot control it. When you eat something bad or your stomach gets upset, the involuntary system sends signals to your brain. The brain then sends signals back to your stomach muscles to make them contract and force the food out. This is called reflexive vomiting. When you see another person vomiting, your brain senses the action through the involuntary system. Then your brain sends signals back to your stomach muscles to make them contract and force the food out. This is also reflexive vomiting. It's possible that some people have an overactive involuntary system. They may not need to sense something in their body to trigger reflexive vomiting. These people may vomit at the sight of another person vomiting."

    "response": "Soap operas are often called \"soap operas\" because they were originally broadcast on radio stations that sold soap and other household products to listeners. The term was adopted for television shows as well. Soap operas are usually set in a fictionalized version of a town or city. Many of these shows take place in the same location throughout their run, so they're easy to identify by sight alone. Soap operas are also instantly recognizable because of their melodramatic plotlines and dramatic storylines. They are often about the lives of ordinary people who live in the fictionalized town or city. Soap operas typically deal with love, family, and romance, and they often feature dramatic conflicts between characters. Soap operas are also known for their long-running nature. Some shows have been on the air for decades, which helps to make them instantly recognizable. Soap operas are popular with many viewers, but some critics have complained about their over-the-top storylines and melodramatic plots. Despite this criticism, soap operas continue to be popular with many viewers."

    "question": "Are option contracts subject to mark to market rules",
    "response": "option 2018, the SEC has proposed new rule 34-159 that would allow companies to use an alternative valuation method for their publicly traded securities. However, under this alternative valuation method, companies will not be required to mark-to-market their securities on a daily basis. This allows companies to provide more flexibility in valuing their securities without having to constantly adjust them to reflect changes in the market. This provides companies with a better way to value their securities and make informed decisions about their investments. This is especially important for companies that have a large number of securities that they hold or trade. This is because marking-to-market can be time-consuming and costly, but it also ensures that companies are accurately reflecting the value of their securities in the market. This is one of the reasons why the SEC proposed this new rule, and it is expected to be well received by companies. This will allow companies to continue to provide transparency to investors while also giving them the flexibility to value their securities in a way that makes sense for their specific situation. This will ensure that investors are always aware of the true value of the company's securities and can make informed decisions about their investment. This is an important step forward in providing transparency to the market and ensuring that investors are always aware of the true value of the company's securities. This will also help to prevent any potential fraud or manipulation of the market, which can harm investors and lead to negative consequences for the entire market.

    "response": "When you turn on your computer or other device, it looks for a signal from the nearest wireless network access point. If you're close enough to a router that broadcasts its signal, your device will connect automatically. If not, you'll have to manually connect to the wireless network. This process is called \"handshaking\" and involves two devices exchanging information in order to establish a connection. The devices use encryption to ensure the security of the information being exchanged. If your device doesn't know what kind of encryption the router uses, it will ask the router for this information. The router will tell your device the encryption type, and then both devices will exchange encryption keys. Encryption keys are special codes that help protect your data. They're used to scramble your data so that only authorized users can read it. This process is repeated every time you try to connect to the wireless network. This process is called \"handshaking.\" The handshaking process takes place automatically when you connect to a wireless network. This means you don't need to remember any passwords or keys.

    "question": "when did secretariat win",
    "response": "2003, the year in which Secretariat won the Triple Crown and set the record for the highest earnings of a thoroughbred racehorse ever. The Triple Crown is a unique accomplishment that has only been achieved three times in the history of horse racing. This year, Secretariat was named the Horse of the Year. In addition to winning the Triple Crown, Secretariat won 18 other races, including the Belmont Stakes. He also ran in the Kentucky Derby, but finished in third place. The Triple Crown consists of three races: the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. Each race is run over different distances, with the Kentucky Derby being the shortest at 1.5 miles and the Belmont Stakes being the longest at 2.45 miles. The Belmont Stakes is also the most prestigious race in the Triple Crown series. The Triple Crown has not been won since 1978, when Affirmed won it. Secretariat's success in winning the Triple Crown was a major factor in his induction into the National Racing Hall of Fame. He is one of only five horses to win all three races in the Triple Crown series. The other four are: Sir Barton (1930), Gallant Fox (1933), Omaha (1943), and Citation (1948). The Triple Crown is an important achievement in horse racing. It is a testament to the horse's ability to perform at its best on the day of the race, and it is also a reflection of the horse's training and preparation. The Triple Crown is often referred to as \"The Most Important Race in Sports.\" The Triple Crown is also the only time in the history of the sport that a horse has won all three races in the series. This makes Secretariat's Triple Crown even more impressive. The Triple Crown is also the only time in the history of the sport that a horse has won all three races in the series.

    "question": "vegetable washing When fruits and verges are covered in pesticides , feces and e - coli these days how does rinsing under running water remove these dangerous things ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "child washes a vegetable under the tap. The vegetables will be safe to eat after being washed this way. However, the vegetables will not be clean enough if they are just rinsed with water from a faucet. This is because: - Some pesticides may remain on the surface of the vegetables. - Feces may stick to the vegetables. - E. coli bacteria may remain on the surface of the vegetables. - Pesticides and other substances may get into the water that is used to rinse the vegetables. This can make the water dirty. If you want to be extra careful, you can also use a vegetable brush to scrub the vegetables. You can find vegetable brushes at most grocery stores or supermarkets. These brushes work well for scrubbing vegetables that have hard skins, such as potatoes and cucumbers. If you are using a vegetable brush, make sure that you wash your hands afterward. If you do not wash your hands, you may spread germs onto your hands. This could make you sick. If you do not want to wash the vegetables, you can peel them. This will remove any pesticides, feces, and E. coli bacteria that may be on the skin of the vegetables. You should still rinse the peeled vegetables under the tap, though. This will help remove any dirt and germs that may be on the surface of the vegetables. If you do not have a vegetable brush or you do not want to peel the vegetables, you can try to remove some of the dirt and germs by rubbing the vegetables under the tap. To do this, hold the vegetables under the running water and rub them gently. If you do not have a vegetable brush, you can also use a damp paper towel to wipe off the dirt and germs from the surface of the vegetables. If you are using a paper towel, make sure to throw it away after you are done wiping the vegetables."

    "question": "can someone explain how a programing language can control a machine Like how does a command actually make something physically happen ? How is text input converted into an action by a machine ? I just do n't understand where it converts from data to physical action . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Okay, so you know that the computer has a bunch of things called registers that store numbers and instructions. Well, the CPU (central processing unit) is a very smart little chip that can take these instructions and perform actions based on them. It's like the brain of the computer. The CPU takes the instructions in the program and performs the actions associated with those instructions. For example, if your program contains an instruction to add two numbers together, the CPU will look at the registers to find the two numbers, add them up, and then put the result back in a register. When the program tells the CPU to print out the number 123456789, the CPU looks for the number in a register, converts it into a series of electrical pulses that can be sent through the computer's internal wiring, and sends the pulses to the printer. The printer receives the pulses and uses them to print the number 123456789. If your program contains an instruction to move the cursor on the screen to the position (X, Y) 100, 200, the CPU will use the registers to find the current location of the cursor, subtract the X coordinate of the new position from the X coordinate of the current position, and subtract the Y coordinate of the new position from the Y coordinate of the current position. Then the CPU will send the difference values to the screen controller, which will use them to move the cursor to the correct position. If the program contains an instruction to display a message on the screen, the CPU will use the registers to find the message, convert the message into a series of electrical pulses, and send the pulses to the screen controller. The screen controller will use the pulses to display the message. So you see, the CPU can perform actions on its own, but it also needs to be told what to do by programs written in programming languages. These programs tell the CPU what actions to take, and the CPU follows the instructions. The programs are stored in memory, and the CPU reads them one at a time, performing the actions associated with each instruction."

    "question": "How do PH values actually work ? Why should ( for example ) going from ph7 to ph8 not to be considered an increase by 1 but an increase as an order of magnitude ? Hope my question makes sense . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "PH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution. The PH scale is a logarithmic scale, meaning that each whole number decrease on the PH scale represents a tenfold increase in the concentration of H+. For example, a solution with a PH of 5 has ten times more H+ than a solution with a PH of 6. The PH of a solution can also be thought of as a measure of the concentration of OH-. A solution with a PH of 7 contains equal amounts of H+ and OH-; this solution is said to be neutral. Solutions with a PH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a PH greater than 7 are basic. A PH of 12 is one hundred thousand times more basic than a PH of 3. The PH scale is used in many fields, including chemistry, biology, and medicine. It is also used to indicate the pH of foods, water, and air. PH is an important parameter in many industrial processes, such as the production of paper, textiles, and paints. PH is also used to determine the quality of drinking water. PH is an important parameter in environmental monitoring, as it indicates the health of aquatic ecosystems. PH is also used to determine the pH of soil and other materials. PH is an important parameter in the study of chemical reactions. PH is also used to determine the pH of blood and other body fluids.

    "question": "Please explain what is \"Family (biology)\"",
    "response": ") Family (biology) and Human Anatomy and Physiology. The human body has a complex system of organs, tissues, and cells that work together to keep the body functioning properly. These systems include the digestive system, respiratory system, circulatory system, nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system. Each system is made up of various organs, tissues, and cells that perform specific functions. For example, the digestive system consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and rectum. The respiratory system includes the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs, and diaphragm. The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and ganglia. The endocrine system consists of the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, thymus, adrenal glands, pancreas, and gonads. The immune system consists of the lymphatic system, bone marrow, spleen, thymus, tonsils, adenoids, and lymph nodes. These systems work together to keep the body functioning properly. For example, the digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that the body can use for energy and growth. The respiratory system brings oxygen into the body and removes carbon dioxide from the body. The circulatory system carries oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells and removes waste products. The nervous system sends signals throughout the body to control movement, sensation, and thought. The endocrine system produces hormones that regulate various bodily processes. The immune system protects the body from disease and infection. In addition, these systems work together to maintain homeostasis, which is the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions.

    "question": "Earwax . What is it and why do I have a lot more of it than my friends ? I 'm constantly having to clean off my headphones and out of my ears and it does n't seem like my friends ever do . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Earwax is made in the outer ear canal and helps keep it healthy by trapping dirt and dust that may get inside. It also keeps the skin inside the ear canal moist. The wax is not sticky; it just clings to the sides of the ear canal. Some people make more earwax than others. This can cause problems if too much wax builds up in the ear canal. A build-up of earwax can cause hearing loss or an earache. Earwax should be removed only by a health care provider. If you think your child has too much earwax, call your doctor. Earwax removal is done in a doctor's office or a clinic. The doctor will use special tools to remove the excess earwax. Your doctor may give you ear drops to help soften the earwax before removing it. Earwax can also be removed at home with over-the-counter ear drops. Earwax softeners are available in pharmacies and stores. The drops work for 10 to 20 minutes and then wash away easily with warm water. Don't put anything else into your ear while the drops are in. Earwax softeners are safe to use as often as needed. However, don't use them for longer than 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, your doctor may prescribe drops that contain a steroid medicine. This medicine can reduce swelling caused by excessive earwax buildup. Earwax softeners are safe to use as often as needed. However, don't use them for longer than 3 weeks.

    "response": "When you press Ctrl-C or Ctrl-V in a command prompt window, the characters are sent to the program running in that window. If the program is a DOS application, it will interpret them as its own commands. But if the program is a Windows application, it will send them to the Windows shell, which then interprets them. If you press Ctrl-C while in the shell, the shell sends the characters to the program running in the foreground window (the one with focus). The program may interpret them as its own commands or it may send them back to the shell, which interprets them as its own commands. The program never knows where the Ctrl-C came from. Similarly, when you press Ctrl-V, the program gets the data from the clipboard and processes it. If you copy some text and paste it into a command prompt window, the text is sent to the shell, which sends it to the program running in the foreground window. If you press Ctrl-V while in the shell, the shell sends the characters to the program running in the foreground window. The program may interpret them as its own commands or it may send them back to the shell, which interprets them as its own commands. The program never knows where the Ctrl-V came from. In short, the shell intercepts your keystrokes and decides where to send them. The program running in the foreground window gets no information about the keystrokes. The shell can't distinguish between Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V because both of these keys send the same character to the shell. To get around this problem, the shell has two special key combinations: Ctrl-\\ sends the character \"\\\" to the program running in the foreground window. Ctrl-^ sends the character \"^\" to the program running in the foreground window. These characters aren't used in any of the standard DOS or Windows commands. You can use them to pass special characters to a program that runs in the foreground window. For example, if you want to run a program that uses the backslash character in its syntax, you can type Ctrl-\\ followed by the backslash character. This sends the backslash character to the program. If you want to run a program that uses the caret character in its syntax, you can type Ctrl-^ followed by the caret character. This sends the caret character to the program. To use these special key combinations, you must be in the shell. You can't use them in a command prompt window. If you want to use them in a command prompt window, you must press Alt-\\ or Alt-^."

    "response": "Chameleons have many more pigments in their skin than do most other animals. These pigments are arranged in layers that are each sensitive to different wavelengths of light. When these pigments are exposed to different wavelengths of light, the chameleon can change the color of its skin. When there is no light exposure, the chameleon's skin is brown or gray. When light is present, the chameleon's skin changes to a bright green color. The chameleon can also change the color of its skin from green to yellow, orange, red, or black. The chameleon can also change its skin to appear as if it is made up of many small spots. The chameleon can also change the color of its skin to match the background it is standing on. This helps it blend into its surroundings. The chameleon has special cells called chromatophores in its skin. These cells contain pigment. The chameleon can control the size of these cells so that it can change its skin color. The chameleon can also control the direction in which light enters its skin.

    "response": "class is a template for objects. A class defines the properties that an object has and the operations that can be performed on it. An object is an instance of a class. An object can be thought of as a data structure that encapsulates both data and functions (methods) that operate on the data. Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class inherits properties from another. The class that inherits properties is called the child class, and the class that provides the properties is called the parent class. Polymorphism is the ability to use objects with similar names but different types of data or operations. In other words, polymorphism allows you to treat an object as if it were an object of a different class. Inheritance and polymorphism are related concepts. Inheritance enables polymorphism. Interfaces define the contract between a class and its clients. A client is any part of the program that uses the class's methods and properties. Inheritance and interfaces are related concepts. Inheritance enables interfaces. Interfaces enable inheritance. A class can implement multiple interfaces. A class can also inherit from multiple classes. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

    "question": "How does Robinhood stock broker make money?",
    "response": "stockbroker makes money by charging commissions and paying out dividends. Investors pay commissions when buying or selling securities through a stockbroker. The stockbroker then pays out the dividend to the investor. Investors should always compare commissions with other factors such as account fees and trading costs. Investors may also want to consider whether they will be able to trade frequently enough to earn back the commission through the income from their investments. The stockbroker earns a commission for each transaction. The commission is usually based on the value of the security being bought or sold. The commission charged is typically a percentage of the purchase price. For example, if you buy $10, worth of stock at a price of $10 per share, the commission might be 1% of the purchase price, or $1. The commission is paid by the investor.

    "question": "How do life insurance companies make a profit ? I 'm guessing they invest the money from payments or something but I 'm not sure . I 've got a feeling that it 's going to be an embarrassingly obvious answer . :/ Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The money you pay for your life insurance is invested in stocks, bonds and other investments. Life insurance companies use your premiums to buy these investments. The money from your premiums pays for the death benefit, which is paid out when you die. The money from your premiums also pays for the company's expenses, such as salaries, taxes, rent, and office supplies. If the money you invest through your life insurance grows faster than the expenses of the company, then the company makes a profit. If the company makes a profit, the profits are divided among the policyholders."

    "response": "good processor can do more than just process information. The more you push the processor, the faster it can process information. This is called over clocking. Over clocking is when you change the settings on your computer so that it runs faster than its normal speed. This is done by changing the voltage and the multiplier. The voltage is how much power the computer gets to run. The multiplier is the ratio of the computer's internal clock speed to the external clock speed. When you change these things, you make the processor run faster. Over clocking can be very dangerous if you do not know what you are doing. It can also damage the processor. Over clocking is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. Over clocking is not recommended unless you know what you are doing.

    "question": "Dreams How does my brain decide what I 'm going to experience in my dreams ? And why ca n't I always remember them ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "-brain. the brain is a very complex organ that has many functions. it is made up of billions of nerve cells called neurons that communicate with each other using electrical signals and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. these neurons form networks that process information and create thoughts, memories, emotions, and sensations. they also control bodily functions such as movement, breathing, and heart rate. however, when you fall asleep, your brain activity slows down and the connections between neurons become weaker. this makes it harder for new information to be stored in memory and for old memories to be retrieved. it also allows you to access your past experiences and feelings while you sleep. this is thought to be the reason why we dream. however, the exact mechanisms behind dreaming are still not well understood. the best explanation so far comes from a theory called the \"activation-synthesis hypothesis,\" which suggests that dreaming is a random firing of neurons that creates patterns that our brain interprets as meaningful images or scenes. however, even this theory is not fully explained yet. for example, we don't know why some people have more vivid dreams than others or why some people can recall their dreams easily while others cannot. it's possible that individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, or function could play a role in how much we dream and how well we remember it. it's also possible that the same person may have different levels of dream recall at different times in their life, depending on factors such as stress, diet, medications, or changes in sleep habits. it's even possible that dreams themselves are not entirely under conscious control, but rather arise from unconscious processes that happen during sleep. researchers are still trying to understand all of these aspects of dreaming. in the meantime, we can try to answer some of your questions about dreams!"

    "question": "What 's wrong with the way we punish sex offenders in the U.S ? Even things that are n't wrong with it would be helpful . I really want to form an opinion but I do n't know enough / need it dumbed down . Thank you ! Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The laws and punishments for sex crimes are not fair or consistent. There is no national law about punishment for sex crimes, so each state has its own rules. The rules vary widely from one state to another. Some states have harsh punishments for all sex crimes. Others have lenient punishments. Some states give more punishment to repeat offenders. Others give the same punishment to first-time offenders. Some states require that the punishment fit the crime. Others don't. This makes it hard to understand what is fair. For example, a first time offender may get a much lighter sentence than a repeat offender who committed the same crime. This is because the laws of each state are different. So, if you read about someone's punishment, you can't compare it to anyone else's punishment. Some people think the laws should be stricter. They say that sex offenders should serve longer sentences. They also say that they should be put in prison for longer periods of time after their release. Other people think the laws should be softer. They say that sex offenders should be able to go back to school or work after serving a short sentence. They also say that they should be able to live near family or friends. These people think that this will help them stay out of trouble. The problem is that there is no right answer. Each person has his or her own ideas about how to punish sex offenders. People have different opinions about what kind of punishment fits the crime. Some people think that sex offenders should be punished harshly. Others think that sex offenders should be treated like everyone else. Some people think that sex offenders should be allowed to go back to school or work. Others think that sex offenders should be forced to stay in jail for years."

    "question": "Evolutionarily speaking , why did the first living cell decide to divide ? Aside from the kick - start of life happening perchance , this is the only thing I really struggle with as far as evolution . What made the first single celled organism decide to propagate ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The first living cells were not the first living things. They were the first to be able to reproduce. The first living things were probably viruses or other infectious particles. These infectious particles could reproduce themselves without needing a host cell. Once the first living cells evolved, they could reproduce without needing a host cell. The first living cells were not able to survive very long outside of a host cell. The first living cells were able to reproduce because they contained genetic material. The genetic material allowed them to store information about how to build more of themselves. The genetic material also allowed them to pass that information on to their offspring. This ability to store and pass on information is what we call heredity. Heredity allows living things to change over time through natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which traits become more or less common in a population over time. Traits that help an organism survive and reproduce become more common. Traits that do not help an organism survive and reproduce become less common. Living things can use energy from the environment to make copies of their genetic material. Living things can use energy from the environment to make copies of their genetic material. This copying of genetic material is called replication. Replication is one reason why the first living cells decided to divide. The first living cells were able to replicate their genetic material. They needed to divide so that each new cell would have its own copy of the genetic material. If they didn't divide, they would eventually run out of genetic material. When that happened, they couldn't make more copies of themselves. This would have led to their death."

    "question": "Exactly what is popping and sizzling when I microwave stuff ? You hear it all the time when you microwave , pretty much , anything . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Here's what happens when you put food in the microwave : The food heats up, causing gas bubbles to form inside of it. The gas expands, causing the food to pop and sizzle. The gas eventually escapes through the food's surface. The process repeats itself over and over until the food has cooled down enough for the gas to escape. The popping and sizzling noises you hear are the gas escaping from the food's surface. The food continues to heat up as long as there's still gas inside it. This is why it takes longer to heat food in the microwave than it does in the oven. The microwave heats up the food directly, rather than heating up the air around the food first. The air doesn't get very hot before the food gets hot, so the food heats up faster. The food also heats up more evenly in the microwave than it does in the oven.

    "question": "How does ATP give our cells energy ? Does that third bond contain a lot of energy ? On a molecular level how does it give us energy , for example in the Na K pump . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Our bodies use energy to move, think, and carry out all of our body functions. We need energy to stay alive and healthy. Energy comes from food we eat and oxygen we breathe. Our bodies turn the food into energy. The energy is used right away or stored in fat for later use. Most of the energy we use comes from carbohydrates and proteins. Carbohydrates and proteins are called macronutrients because we need them in large amounts. Fats are also macronutrients. Fats provide the most energy per gram. But we only need small amounts of fats. The rest of the energy we need comes from the calories in the vitamins and minerals we get from fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and other foods. Vitamins and minerals are called micronutrients because we need them in smaller amounts. All of the macronutrients and micronutrients we get from food must be broken down and absorbed by our digestive system. Then they are transported through our bloodstream to cells throughout our bodies. Cells can use the energy in food to make chemical reactions happen. These reactions are called metabolic processes. Metabolic processes keep our bodies working. They include making our blood circulate, keeping our heart beating, and thinking. The energy in food is used up as we do these metabolic processes. We have two types of metabolic processes: anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism is when cells build molecules. Catabolism is when cells break down molecules. Anabolism uses energy to build molecules. Catabolism uses energy to break down molecules. Anabolism and catabolism work together. The two types of metabolic processes are very important. For example, if we don't have enough anabolism, we may not grow properly. If we don't have enough catabolism, we may gain weight. If we have too much catabolism, we may lose weight. If we have too much anabolism, we may store too much fat. We can't live without both types of metabolic processes. We need anabolism and catabolism to stay alive."

    "question": "What causes severe abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea?Hi, I have severe abdominal pain and it would not stop. I am unable to sleep too. I hear my stomach growling and my bowel movement, the diarrhea is just yellow watery fluid. My stomach is also bloated and I lost my appetite. Whatever food I do eat, I ended up vomiting all out within 2 hours.",
    "response": "What Causes Severe Abdominal Pain, Bloating, and Diarrhea? Your doctor may find that your symptoms are caused by an infection or a problem with your digestive system (gastrointestinal tract). The most common cause of abdominal pain and diarrhea is a viral or bacterial infection. Less commonly, other conditions can cause these symptoms. Viral Infections Many viruses cause diarrhea. The two most common viruses that cause diarrhea in children are rotavirus and norovirus. Rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrhea in children worldwide. It usually causes watery diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. Most children get sick from rotavirus during the first year of life. Once you have had rotavirus, you will probably not get it again. Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that spreads quickly through communities and large groups of people, such as on cruise ships and in nursing homes. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Norovirus is also called \"stomach flu,\" though it is not related to influenza. Food Poisoning Food poisoning occurs when you eat foods contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins. Food poisoning can occur when food is contaminated before, during, or after preparation. Bacteria and Parasites Contaminated food can contain many types of bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Some examples are: Salmonella Shigella Vibrio cholerae E. coli Giardia amoebae Listeria monocytogenes Campylobacter Toxoplasma gondii Food poisoning symptoms may include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Food poisoning can be mild to severe. Some types of food poisoning can be deadly if not treated. Bacterial Food Poisoning Bacterial food poisoning is the most common type of food poisoning. Bacteria found in contaminated food may cause diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness, and dehydration. Bacteria that can cause food poisoning include: Staphylococcus aureus This bacterium produces a toxin that can cause food poisoning. The toxin is heat stable and therefore cannot be destroyed by cooking. Staphylococcus aureus is found in the noses and throats of about one in 20 healthy people. It is easily spread through the air and through direct contact with infected people. The bacteria are present in the environment and can survive for days in refrigerated areas. They also can be transferred to food during food preparation. Bacillus cereus Bac"

    "question": "Why do I cough when I eat a banana ? Is it just me ? D : Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "lot of things can cause you to cough. However, if you have a cough that won't go away or is worse than usual, it's important to get it checked out by your doctor. Some things that can cause you to cough include colds and the flu, allergies, asthma, and more serious conditions such as heart disease or lung cancer. The list goes on. 2. Coughing is one of the body's ways of getting rid of something that shouldn't be in your airways. If you have a cough, it's probably because your body is trying to get rid of something that's stuck in your airways. 3. Your airways are lined with tiny hairs called cilia. These hairs beat back and forth and help move mucus (a clear, slippery substance) up and out of your lungs. This helps keep your lungs healthy. When you have a cough, it's likely that your cilia are working overtime to get rid of something that's stuck in your airways. 4. Your body also has other ways of getting rid of foreign objects. For example, your stomach acid can help get rid of small particles that get into your mouth while you're eating. 5. If you have a cough, it's important to see your doctor so he or she can figure out what's causing it. Sometimes, a cough can be a sign of a serious condition. If you have a cough that won't go away or is worse than usual, it's important to get it checked out by your doctor."

    "question": "Ovarian cysts, endometriosis, trying to conceiveHello i have been tryin to get pregnant for almost two years...i have had ovarian cysts since i was 12 years old and have endometriosis i need help its getting to emotional",
    "response": "I'm sorry to hear that you've been trying to get pregnant for so long. The good news is that with your history of ovarian cysts and endometriosis, you'll want to make sure you're on the right birth control method. There are several types of birth control, including: - Hormonal methods, such as oral contraceptives (birth control pills), injections, implants, and patches. - Barrier methods, such as condoms or diaphragms. - Intrauterine devices (IUDs). You can find more information about these methods at www.contraceptivechoices.org. If you choose to use hormonal birth control, be aware that some forms of birth control pills can increase your risk of endometriosis flare-ups. For example, if you take oral contraceptives containing estrogen and progestin together, you may have more symptoms of endometriosis. Also, some women who have endometriosis report having more pain during their menstrual cycles while using birth control pills. However, it's important to know that there are many different brands and types of birth control pills. Some contain only progestin and do not have estrogen. These pills are often recommended for women who have endometriosis. If you decide to use hormonal birth control, talk to your health care provider about which type of pill might work best for you. You should also discuss any side effects you might experience. It's important to keep in mind that you may not be able to get pregnant for up to 1 year after starting hormonal birth control. This delay allows your body to adjust to the hormones. If you're using other types of birth control, such as the patch, ring, or IUD, talk to your health care provider about how long you should wait before trying to get pregnant. You'll want to wait until you've had a period after you start using a new type of birth control. This will help you see whether you're ovulating. You can learn more about this topic at www.breastcancer.org/ovarian/cancer-prevention/ovarian-cancer-risk-factors.html. You'll also want to make sure you're eating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise. Many women gain weight when they become pregnant, but if you're overweight or obese, gaining weight could make it harder to get pregnant. Being overweight can also cause problems with ovulation. Talk to your health care provider about ways to lose weight if you're overweight or obese. Your doctor may recommend weight-loss surgery,"

    "question": "Is n't cheap oil a good thing ? Sometimes I read headlines saying it 's not good . Is n't that an initiative of Saudi Arabia trying to kill the North Dakota oil sector ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "We need to get the facts straight about how the oil industry is doing in North Dakota and across the country. The state's oil and gas industry has been a huge economic driver for our state. It has created thousands of jobs, many of which pay well, and has helped bring in billions of dollars in tax revenue. In fact, in 2014 alone, North Dakota's oil and gas industry generated $1.3 billion in state income tax revenue, $700 million in corporate income tax revenue, and $2.6 billion in severance tax revenue. This year, the industry is expected to bring in even more tax revenue. In addition, the industry has provided millions of dollars in local government revenue through property taxes. All told, oil and gas activity in North Dakota is estimated to have added $8 billion to our state's economy since 2010. While we're proud of the impact that the industry has had on our state, we must also be honest about its downsides. Oil and gas drilling can have a negative impact on the environment and public health if it's not done properly. That's why North Dakota has one of the strongest environmental laws in the country, including some of the toughest standards for air and water quality. In addition, the state requires companies to take steps to protect the public and the environment before, during and after drilling operations. The industry continues to face significant challenges, including low oil prices and the ongoing fight against the spread of the Bakken's microfracturing bacteria. We must continue to work together to find solutions to these challenges. But the good news is that the industry remains strong. In fact, despite the recent drop in oil prices, the number of active oil and gas wells in North Dakota is at an all-time high. This means that the industry continues to create new jobs, generate new tax revenue and strengthen our state's economy. So while the industry faces some challenges, it remains a key part of our state's economy."

    "question": "Why is everyone trying to sell me gold ? So if gold is such a great investment right now and all the banks are buying it up , why are there so many companies trying to sell it to me everywhere I turn ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Gold is a good investment because it doesnt lose its value. It will always be worth something. Gold has been used as money for thousands of years. It has never gone out of style. It also makes jewelry and coins. The price of gold is usually higher than other metals. If you buy gold now, you can keep it in your home safe or bank vault. You dont have to worry about it getting stolen. If you buy it from a company, they will take care of storing it for you. Gold doesnt get old or break down like paper money or plastic money. It doesnt go bad and it doesnt rot. If you have some gold at home, you can melt it down and make new jewelry. If you buy gold from a company, they will do that for you. The price of gold has risen and fallen over the years. But it always comes back. The price of gold goes up and down with the economy. If the economy is doing well, people want to buy more things. They need more money. So they pay more for gold. If the economy isnt doing well, people want to save their money. They dont want to spend it. So theyll buy less gold. You shouldnt buy gold just because the price is going up. You should buy it because you want to keep it for yourself. If you think the price of gold will go up, then you should buy it. If you think the price of gold will go down, then you should wait and see what happens before you buy it. If you buy gold from a company, they will tell you what they think will happen to the price of gold. Then you can decide if you want to buy it. You should buy gold because you want to keep it for yourself. If you think the price of gold will go up, then you should buy it. If you think the price of gold will go down, then you should wait and see what happens before you buy it.

    "question": "Hydraulic Press Exploding Book URL_0 The latest Hydraulic Press video came out and a large book exploded . Can someone ELI5 how this can happen ? What is happening on a molecular level ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": ": Hydraulic Press Exploding Book This video was made to show what happens when the hydraulic press is used incorrectly. In the video, a large book is placed between two plates of the hydraulic press. The operator then begins to raise the top plate, causing the pressure in the hydraulic fluid to increase. When the pressure reaches 12,000 pounds per square inch, the book explodes! The explosion is caused by the pressure in the hydraulic fluid pushing against the book and the metal cover. The metal cover is very strong and can withstand a lot of pressure. However, the book cannot. The paper and ink in the book are not strong enough to resist the force of the hydraulic fluid. As the pressure increases, the paper and ink in the book become more compressed. Eventually, the paper and ink will break apart and the book will explode! The pressure in the hydraulic fluid continues to increase until it reaches 12,000 pounds per square inch. At this point, the pressure in the fluid exceeds the strength of the book. The book breaks apart and the hydraulic fluid escapes from the press. The hydraulic fluid does not contain any dangerous chemicals or gases that could harm anyone if it spills. The hydraulic fluid is simply water with a few additives that make it easier to pump through the pipes. The fluid is also fire resistant. The hydraulic fluid will not ignite in most situations. However, it should never be used near an open flame or electrical source."

    "question": "Why does a cable company ( Comcast for instance ) charge me for \" basic \" cable that is standard definition when a simple cheap antenna gives me a HD picture for free ? I just can not understand this . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Cable TV is a system of transmitting television signals from a central station to homes and businesses through a network of underground cables or fiber-optic cables. The signal is transmitted over the airwaves or through satellite transmission. This type of TV is called \"over-the-air\" because it doesn't require a cable connection to get your channels. It's also called \"terrestrial\" because it travels over the ground. Cable TV uses special equipment to transmit the signals. The equipment includes a head end, which is the place where the signals are received and processed; distribution systems, which are the lines that carry the signals from the head end to the customer's home; and drop boxes, which are the small metal boxes that connect the distribution system to the home. Satellite TV is another way to get TV without a cable connection. Instead of using cables, satellite TV uses radio waves sent up into space from a large dish on a tower. These waves are then sent down to your home by satellite. Satellite TV is called \"direct broadcast satellite\" (DBS) because it transmits signals directly to your home. The equipment used to receive satellite TV is called a satellite receiver. A satellite receiver is a device that receives and processes the satellite signals. It's connected to your TV, so you can watch the programs. The satellite receiver is usually included in the price of the satellite TV service. In addition to cable TV and satellite TV, there are other ways to get TV. One way is to use an antenna. An antenna is a device that receives signals from a TV station and sends them to your TV. The most common type of antenna is the rooftop outdoor antenna. Another type of antenna is the indoor antenna. Indoor antennas are smaller than rooftop antennas. They're designed to fit inside your house or apartment. Some people use a combination of antennas and cable TV or satellite TV to get their TV. For example, they might use an antenna to receive local TV signals and cable or satellite TV for the rest of the channels. Some people even use more than one antenna at the same time. They might use one antenna to receive local TV signals and another antenna to receive signals from a different TV station. For example, they might use one antenna to receive ABC TV and another antenna to receive CBS TV. This allows them to watch two different TV stations at the same time."

    "response": "The Holocaust was not planned or carried out in one day. It began in 1933 and continued until 1945. It took place in two parts: The first part lasted from 1933 to 1938. This is called the \"Nazi Era.\" During this time, Hitler and his Nazi party took control of Germany. They made laws that discriminated against Jews and other groups. These groups included people with disabilities, Roma (Gypsies), homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Communists, Socialists, and others. The Nazis also made laws against Catholics, Protestants, and those who didn't believe in any religion. They also made laws against trade unions and strikes. They wanted to take control of the country. In 1938, the Nazis began a program to \"Aryanize\" (make Aryan) the German economy. This meant forcing non-Aryans to sell their businesses to Aryans. The Nazis also forced people to give up their homes and move into Jewish ghettos. The ghettos were areas in cities where Jews were forced to live. The ghettos were surrounded by walls or fences. Jews were not allowed to leave the ghettos. They were only allowed to go outside to work. The Nazis made the Jews wear yellow stars on their clothes. This way, they could tell who was Jewish. The second part of the Holocaust began in 1941. This is called the \"Final Solution.\" The Final Solution was a plan to kill all the Jews in Europe. The Final Solution started in Poland in 1941. In the summer of 1941, the Nazis invaded Poland. They killed about 6 million Polish Jews. The Nazis also killed about 2 million Soviet POWs (prisoners of war). In 1941, the Nazis began to send Jews to the death camps. The death camps were places where the Nazis murdered Jews. The Nazis sent Jews to the death camps in trucks and trains. They were told to get off the trucks and trains at a certain place. At that place, they were told to undress and put their belongings in a pile. Then they were told to get back into the trucks and trains. They were taken to the gas chambers. There, they were killed with gas. The gas was carbon monoxide from an exhaust pipe. The gas would kill everyone inside the truck. After the gas had done its job, the bodies were taken"

    "question": "Why is Orange Juice kept in the refrigerated case near the milk at the supermarket , yet the Apple / Grape / Cranberry / Tomato / Etc . Juice is on a shelf in the middle of the store ? What makes OJ so special ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Orange juice contains Vitamin C and other antioxidants that may help prevent or delay some types of cancer. Vitamin C also helps keep your immune system strong and aids in the healing process. It is also a good source of potassium, which is an important mineral for heart health. Vitamin C is not found in significant amounts in most other fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C is lost quickly when fruit juices are exposed to air and heat during processing. To keep as much vitamin C as possible, use fresh orange juice right away. If you have leftover juice, refrigerate it. If you want to freeze orange juice, make sure you do not freeze the juice with the container still attached. This could damage the container and cause it to leak. Frozen orange juice should be thawed slowly in the refrigerator. If you buy frozen juice concentrate, read the label carefully to find out how much water is added. The more water added, the less vitamin C the juice will contain. For example, if a 1 cup serving of juice contains 30 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C and there are 12 cups of juice in the container, then each cup of juice would contain 2.5 mg of vitamin C. If a 1 cup serving of juice contains 60 mg of vitamin C and there are 8 cups of juice in the container, then each cup of juice would contain 7.5 mg of vitamin C. When you buy orange juice, look for the words \"100 percent\" or \"pure\" before the name of the fruit on the label. This means that 100 percent of the liquid is orange juice. If a product has only \"orange\" or \"orange flavor\" on the label, it does not have to contain any orange juice."

    "response": "Your body needs to have enough sleep to function properly. It's called \"sleep debt\" when you don't get enough sleep. If you get too much sleep, you may not feel rested and refreshed. Sleep experts say it takes about 30 minutes for your body to go through all the stages of sleep. So if you get too much sleep, you'll wake up still tired. For example, if you normally sleep 7 hours, but you sleep 12 hours one night, you may still be tired the next day. This can happen if you're having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. If you think you may have sleep problems, talk with your doctor. He or she can help you find out why you're having trouble sleeping and how to fix it. If you're feeling tired even after getting enough sleep, you may have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder in which you stop breathing during sleep. It causes loud snoring and pauses in breathing. People who have sleep apnea usually feel tired and sleepy during the day. They also may have high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. If you think you may have sleep apnea, talk with your doctor. He or she can help you find out if you have it and how to fix it. You may need to lose weight, stop smoking, or use a machine called a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. CPAP machines keep your airways open while you sleep. If you have sleep apnea, it's important to get treatment. Sleep apnea can cause serious health problems. If you have sleep apnea, you should talk with your doctor about treatment. He or she can tell you more about the condition and how to treat it."

    "question": "Why is everything becoming gluten free ? Back in England we do n't care but in Australia everything 's pretty much advertised as gluten free .. What 's the benefits ? Why should I care if a food has gluten in it ? I 'm not celiac . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Gluten-free foods are those that do not contain any of the following: - Wheat - Rye - Barley - Malt and malt products - Spelt - Kamut Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes oats. People with celiac disease cannot digest gluten. If they eat food containing gluten, their bodies react to it by damaging the small intestine. This damage stops the body from getting nutrients from food. Over time, this can lead to serious health problems, such as osteoporosis, nerve damage, infertility, and even cancer. People who have celiac disease must avoid all foods containing gluten. Even a tiny amount of gluten can cause damage. If you have celiac disease, your doctor will tell you what foods are safe for you to eat. He or she also may recommend special vitamin and mineral supplements. The good news is that many foods are naturally gluten-free, including fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, poultry, rice, corn, and dairy products. There are many other foods that do not contain gluten. These include breads, crackers, cookies, cakes, pies, sauces, soups, and gravies. Many of these foods are made from flour. So you need to read the labels carefully. If you have celiac disease, your doctor may want you to see a dietitian. A dietitian is a health professional who specializes in food and nutrition. He or she can help you plan meals that are right for you. You also can ask a family member or friend to check food labels for you. The best way to know if a food contains gluten is to read the label. Some foods have ingredients lists that show whether they contain gluten. For example, a bagel might say \"contains wheat\" on its package. Other foods do not have ingredient lists. In that case, you would have to call the company. If you don't recognize a food's name, call the manufacturer and ask whether it contains gluten. You also can look at the Nutrition Facts panel on the back of packaged foods. On this panel, you'll find a line that says \"gluten.\" This line shows whether the food contains gluten. If the food does contain gluten, the FDA requires that the word \"gluten\" be listed below the \"gluten\" line. If a food doesn't contain gluten, the word \"gluten-free\" appears under the \"gluten\" line. It's important to note that some foods are naturally gluten-free, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, meat"

    "response": "Cats don't like water for a few reasons: 1. Cats are not naturally aquatic animals. They evolved in dry environments, so they do not have an instinct to swim. 2. Cats have a high body temperature and can overheat in water. 3. Cats' ears are located at the top of their heads, which means they have less control over their balance while swimming. Cats also have poor vision underwater. 4. Cats are prey animals and would be easy targets for predators if they swam. Cats may also fear that water might wash them away or cause them to drown.

    "question": "How does a DVD work ? How is data stored on a DVD , and how is it read by DVD players and computers and stuff ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "DVD is an optical disk that uses laser light to read information stored on the surface of the disk. DVDs can store more information than CDs, and they're faster and easier to read. This makes them perfect for movies and music, but also for other kinds of data. DVDs have a lot of advantages over older storage media such as floppy disks and tapes. They're small and easy to carry around, and you can write new data onto them many times without wearing them out. DVDs are also very fast. Most DVD players can read a movie in under two minutes. DVDs can be read by both computers and DVD players, so they're great for watching movies on your computer or burning your own movies and music to play on a DVD player. DVDs are also used to store data for use in computers. DVDs can hold up to 4.7 gigabytes (GB) of data, which is enough space for a large number of photos, videos, or other types of files. DVDs are also used for backup purposes. If you want to keep copies of your important files safe, you can burn them to DVDs. DVDs are a lot smaller and lighter than hard drives, and they're much less expensive. DVDs are also safer than CDs. CDs can get scratched, but DVDs are protected by a hard plastic case that keeps them from getting scratched. DVDs are made from polycarbonate plastic, which is a strong material that's not as fragile as glass.

    "response": "Black holes are very heavy objects in space that have a strong gravity because they are so dense. The gravity of black holes is so strong that even light cannot escape from them. Black holes are formed when very massive stars die. In the death throes of a star, all the outward pressure from nuclear fusion is gone and gravity takes over. If the star is very massive, its gravity will pull in all the matter around it. As the star collapses inward, the matter gets more and more squeezed together. Eventually the matter gets so squeezed together that it becomes a singularity, a point where everything is packed together into an infinitely small volume. The density at this point is infinite. The density of a black hole increases as it gets bigger. If the star is big enough, its gravity will pull in the surrounding matter until it forms a black hole. Black holes get their name from the fact that they \"swallow\" anything that comes near them, including light. Black holes have a \"surface\" called the event horizon. Once an object crosses the event horizon, it will never return. It will keep falling deeper and deeper into the black hole. It will eventually hit the singularity. Black holes also have an inner region called the shadow. This is the area inside the event horizon where light cannot escape. Light outside the black hole cannot escape either. So light from the black hole's shadow cannot reach us. That's why we can't see the shadow of the black hole. We can only infer that it exists by looking at what's happening to things that come close to it. Black holes can grow larger by swallowing other stars and planets. They can also shrink down to a size of a single atom or smaller by spewing out matter through a process called Hawking radiation. This is the same kind of radiation that is predicted to exist in the empty space between stars. Black holes also evaporate over time. This happens because black holes emit particles of light and heat. These particles of light and heat carry away energy from the black hole. Over time, the black hole loses energy and gets smaller. This is called evaporation. Black holes also get smaller if they absorb matter and energy from the surrounding environment. This happens because the matter and energy add mass to the black hole, which makes it bigger. Black holes get bigger if they release matter and energy into the surrounding environment. This happens because the matter and energy take away mass from the black hole, which makes it smaller."

    "response": "The answer is that it's not true! The study that found a difference in life expectancy between left and right handed people was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 1989. The study looked at 50,000 people over 20 years and concluded that the average lifespan for left handed people was 7.5 years less than that of right handed people. The study also found that people who were ambidextrous (able to use both hands equally well) had an even shorter lifespan. However, many other studies since then have shown no significant difference in life expectancy between left and right handed people. One recent study followed more than 30,000 people from 1990 to 2004 and found that there was no difference in lifespan between left and right handed people. Other studies have found that left handed people are at greater risk for certain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, but these diseases do not affect lifespan. There are some theories about why left handed people might have a higher risk of certain diseases, but there is no proof that being left handed causes any health problems. The BMJ article that first reported a difference in lifespan between left and right handed people has been retracted because of the poor quality of the study. In addition, the author of the article has been criticized for lying about his education and for plagiarism. Left handed people may be at greater risk for some diseases because they are more likely to get into accidents. People who drive or operate heavy machinery are more likely to have accidents if they are left handed. For example, left handed people are more likely to be killed or injured in car accidents. Left handed people are also more likely to fall and hurt themselves.

    "question": "How come if we hear our own voices lower , how can we sing on pitch ? Accidentally posted to URL_0 so I reposted to switched subreddits . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When you sing, your brain sends signals through your vocal cords that make them vibrate and produce sound. These signals also tell the muscles in your face and jaw to move in a way that makes your voice sound clear and strong. However, sometimes these signals don't work as well as they should. For example, your brain might send signals that are too weak or too strong. This can cause your voice to sound muffled, unclear, or even robotic. Other times, your vocal cords may not vibrate properly, which can cause your voice to sound hoarse or scratchy. When this happens, it's hard for your brain to control your voice. Your brain has to work harder to fix the problem. It may try to fix the problem by sending stronger signals to your vocal cords. But if the problem is really bad, your brain might not be able to fix it. The result is a voice that sounds different from your normal voice. This can make it hard to sing on pitch. 10.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1."

    "question": "Why do certain foods seem to trigger vivid dreams ? In my case , spicy take - out Italian foods cause incredibly graphic , true - to - life dreams and nightmares . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Your body is like a computer that processes information from the food you eat. It sends this information to your brain, which turns it into dream pictures. The way you feel after eating can affect your dreams. For example, if you're hungry or tired, your dreams might be short and not very clear. If you've had too much to drink, you might have strange dreams about drinking or falling down. The food you eat may also change how you feel after you go to sleep. If you eat a lot of salty foods before bedtime, you might feel thirsty and wake up in the middle of the night. This could cause you to have bad dreams. If you eat spicy foods, your heart may beat faster, making you restless while you sleep. You might dream about being chased or falling. If you eat lots of dairy foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, you might dream about eating or vomiting these foods. Some people think that dreaming about eating or vomiting these foods means you need to cut back on them. If you don't eat enough protein before bedtime, you might dream about eating meat. You might even feel hungry while you're sleeping. This could make you wake up hungry. Some people think that dreaming about eating meat means you need to eat more protein. If you eat lots of chocolate before bedtime, you might dream about eating or drinking chocolate. If you eat lots of fatty foods before bedtime, you might dream about being sick. You might also have bad dreams about eating or vomiting fatty foods."

    "question": "Why does drinking sea water dehydrate you ? I understand there is a lot of salt in sea water but I do n't understand why you still ca n't use the water available . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. These atoms bond together to form H2O molecules. The H2O molecules are so small that they can pass through your body's cells. However, sodium chloride (NaCl) molecules are too big to pass through the cells. When you drink sea water, it passes through your cells and into your blood. Your body needs sodium and chloride to function. However, your body can only hold so much sodium and chloride. If you drink more than your body can hold, it will pull the sodium and chloride from your blood and put them into your cells. This leaves your blood with less sodium and chloride than it needs. As a result, your body will pull water from your cells to balance out the sodium and chloride levels in your blood. This causes your cells to shrink. As a result, you feel thirsty. To quench your thirst, you'll drink even more water, which pulls more sodium and chloride from your blood and puts them into your cells. This continues until your body has enough sodium and chloride for its needs. Then your thirst disappears. Because your body can't get rid of excess sodium and chloride, it continues to draw water from your cells. As a result, you lose more water than you take in. This makes you dehydrated."

    "question": "Please explain what is \"Java (programming language)\"",
    "response": "The Java programming language (also known as simply Java) is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers use common programming constructs across different operating systems and hardware platforms. The Java language was developed at Sun Microsystems by James Gosling and others. It is an extension of the C++ programming language, with a number of new features. In addition, Java has been extended by the Java Community Process to include new language and platform features. See also: Java (programming language) The Java programming language is not a single language, but rather a collection of related languages. A language consists of a set of rules that define the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the language. These rules are used to determine whether a sequence of actions constitutes correct or incorrect usage of the language. For example, the syntax rules define the way in which characters must be combined to form valid statements; the semantics rules define the meaning of these statements; and the pragmatics rules define how a particular statement should be executed. The Java language is composed of several sub-languages, each of which is a complete language in its own right. The main sub-languages of Java are Java itself, JavaBeans, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF). The Java language is an extension of the C++ programming language. The following table shows the differences between the Java and C++ languages. Java C++ 1. Java has no pointers to objects. 2. Java has no explicit declaration of classes. 3. Java has no explicit declaration of functions. 4. Java has no explicit declaration of variables. 5. Java has no explicit declaration of arrays. 6. Java has no explicit declaration of exceptions. 7. Java has no explicit declaration of inheritance. 8. Java has no explicit declaration of templates. 9. Java has no explicit declaration of interfaces. 10.

    "question": "What are the crazy uncontrollable muscle twitches ? My arm has been twitching / Flexing for about 22hours now . I do n't like it . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Muscle twitching is when a group of muscles or a single muscle in your body suddenly contracts or tightens. Twitching can happen anywhere in your body. It may be hard to control. Muscle twitching is different from a cramp. A cramp is a sudden, intense muscle contraction that causes pain. Twitching is less painful and lasts longer than a cramp. Twitching is usually harmless. However, if you have muscle twitching that lasts more than a day, you should talk to your doctor. Twitching may be caused by: - Lack of sleep. - Stress. - Too much caffeine. - An illness or infection. - Taking certain medicines. - Drinking too much alcohol. Twitching may also be caused by a condition called essential tremor. This condition causes involuntary, rhythmic shaking of one or more parts of your body. Essential tremor is often mild and does not cause serious health problems. However, it can make it hard to perform tasks such as writing, drinking coffee, or holding a cup. Twitching may be treated with medicine. You can also try to reduce your stress and get enough sleep. If you drink alcohol, try to limit how much you drink. If you smoke, try to quit smoking. You can also try massaging the twitching muscle or relaxing it by using heat or cold. If these things don't work, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to help relieve the twitching."

    "response": "It's your money, so you pay for it. The gas station is giving you a discount on your purchase of gas at their store. It is a way to get you to shop at their store more often. They hope that you will use their store as your go-to place for groceries and gas. If you do, they make more money. They give you the discount in hopes that you will buy more of their products. It's a marketing strategy. It doesn't cost them anything. The only thing they have to do is give you the discount when you fill up with gas. They don't have to give you the discount if you don't buy gas at their store. You can find out how much you earn on your gas purchases from the pump. Most gas stations have a sign or placard showing the discounts. You can also ask an employee at the gas station for this information."

    "response": "Tipping is a way of saying \"thank you\" for good service. If you think about it, the bartender doesn't actually do anything to deserve that money. The bartender does not make the drinks or prepare them. They don't even serve them. It's the wait staff who does all of that. The bartender just makes sure the wait staff has everything they need to make the drinks. Tipping is a tradition that began with waiters and waitresses. It was the custom in France to give the waiter a small gift of money after the meal. It was called a gratuity. The practice spread to other parts of Europe and then to the United States. In the early days of the United States, the practice of tipping was used in hotels and restaurants. The practice of tipping has been around for many years. Most people believe that tipping is a tradition in the United States. Some people say that tipping is a way to show appreciation to the waiter or waitress for the work he or she did.

This condition can cause pain and numbness in your back and legs. The symptoms of upper back pain vary depending on the cause. Muscle strain or injury may cause sharp pain in the upper back that gets worse with movement. Osteoarthritis can cause a dull, constant ache in the upper back. Osteoporosis usually does not cause any symptoms until a fracture occurs. Herniated disk may cause sharp pain that feels like an electric shock or tingling down the leg. You may also feel pain, numbness, or weakness in your arms or legs. If you have upper back pain, you should see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment plan.

    "response": "The most common type of ovarian cancer is called epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). EOC starts from the cells that line the surface of the ovary. The term \"epithelial\" refers to the tissue covering the surface of the ovary. Most epithelial ovarian cancers start in the cells on the surface of the ovary. Other types of ovarian cancer include germ cell tumors, stromal tumors, and sex cord-stromal tumors. A tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors are not cancerous. Malignant tumors are cancerous. They can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. The type of ovarian cancer depends on where the cancer starts. - Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: This is the most common type of ovarian cancer. It starts in the cells that cover the surface of the ovary. This type of ovarian cancer can be divided into several subtypes based on the type of cells involved. - Germ Cell Tumors: This type of ovarian cancer begins in the germ cells, which are found in the ovaries. These cells develop into eggs (ova) and sperm. - Stromal Tumors: This type of ovarian cancer starts in the cells that support the egg and make hormones. - Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors: This type of ovarian cancer begins in the cells that connect with the egg. These cells also make hormones. There are many different types of sex cord-stromal tumors. The treatment for ovarian cancer depends on the type of cancer, how far the cancer has spread, and whether the cancer has been treated before. If you have symptoms of ovarian cancer, you should see your doctor right away. You should not wait until your next scheduled appointment. Your doctor will talk with you about all of your treatment choices. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or hormone therapy. Surgery may be used to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Hormone therapy is a type of treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action. Hormones are chemical substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If you have a family history of ovarian cancer, you should talk with your doctor about genetic testing. Genetic testing"

    "response": "? that you may be at risk for atherosclerosis. The good news is that you can take steps to lower your risk of developing atherosclerosis. These steps include eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and not smoking. Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. This buildup narrows your arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Over time, this reduction in blood flow may lead to chest pain, heart attack, or stroke. Atherosclerosis also can reduce blood flow to other parts of your body, such as your head, neck, brain, kidneys, and limbs. As your risk of atherosclerosis increases, the damage caused by plaque buildup in your arteries increases too. When plaque builds up in your coronary (heart) arteries, it limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. This condition is called coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease. It's the leading cause of heart attacks. If you think you may be at risk for atherosclerosis, talk with your doctor about ways to lower your risk. Learn more about atherosclerosis.

    "response": "Coughs can be caused by many things, including the common cold, allergies, sinus infections, asthma, and other respiratory conditions. A cough can also be a symptom of heart failure. Coughing is your body's way of trying to rid itself of unwanted particles, such as dust, pollen, smoke, or other irritants that get into your airways. The cough reflex is triggered by irritation of the nerve endings in your lungs and airways. These nerve endings sense irritants and send signals to your brain. Your brain then sends a message back to your lungs to expel the irritant from your lungs. This message travels through your body by way of your nerves. A cough can be triggered by anything that irritates the lining of the airways, including: - cold air - cigarette smoke - air pollution - dust - mold - strong odors - acid reflux - allergies - exercise - GERD - viral or bacterial infections - asthma - lung cancer - smoking - postnasal drip - tumors in the airways or lungs - heart failure - medications that cause side effects such as dryness of the mouth - certain foods - alcohol - chemicals or other substances that irritate the lungs - radiation therapy for cancer - certain medical conditions that affect the lungs and airways. A cough can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Acute Cough An acute cough lasts for a short time and is usually caused by a temporary illness. Acute coughs may last from a few days to a couple of weeks. Acute coughs may be caused by: - colds - flu - bronchitis - pneumonia - whooping cough - allergies - sinus infections - asthma - acid reflux - GERD. Chronic Cough A chronic cough lasts for more than eight weeks. Chronic coughs may be caused by: - asthma - chronic bronchitis - GERD - postnasal drip - chronic sinus infections - allergic rhinitis - heart failure. If you have a chronic cough, it's important to find out what's causing it. If you have a cough lasting longer than eight weeks, talk with your doctor about what might be causing it. You should see your doctor if your cough persists after eight weeks, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever. If you have a chronic cough, it's important to find out what's causing it. If you have a cough lasting longer than eight weeks, talk with your doctor about what might be causing it. You should"

    "response": "(Vice) - The documentary was titled \"The Japanese Women Who Pay For Men\" and it showed how some young Japanese women were paying for dates. In the documentary, a woman named Yumi said that she pays for dates because she's too shy to approach men and is afraid of rejection. The documentary also showed that many of these women were willing to pay for dates because they thought that men would be more willing to give them gifts. However, in other parts of the world, women have always had more freedom and choice when it comes to dating. There is a cultural difference between Japan and other places where women have more freedom and choice when it comes to dating. In Japan, the traditional view of marriage is based on the idea that a man should provide for his wife. This means that a woman may feel that she needs to pay for a date in order to make a man want to marry her. Also, in Japan, a woman may feel that she needs to pay for a date in order to impress the man and show that she has money. However, in other parts of the world, women have always had more freedom and choice when it comes to dating.

    "response": "the Yellowstone volcano has been dormant for about 750, 000 years. That means that it is unlikely to erupt in the near future. However, if it does erupt, it could cause significant damage to the surrounding areas. The last time the Yellowstone volcano erupted was around 640, 000 years ago. It is possible that it will erupt again in the future. There is a chance that it could happen sooner than later. It is difficult to predict when it will erupt, but scientists are studying the area to try to better understand the volcanic activity and potential risks. There are currently no signs that the Yellowstone volcano is about to erupt. However, there is always a risk that it could happen at any time. If it does erupt, it could be devastating to the surrounding areas. It is important to keep an eye on the area and to be prepared in case of an eruption.

    "response": "There is no easy way to make salt water drinkable. We have to remove the salt from the water. There are two ways to do this: 1) Distillation - This involves heating the water until it evaporates into vapor, and then condensing the vapor back into liquid form. The salt remains behind. 2) Reverse Osmosis - This involves pushing the salt water through a membrane that only lets water molecules through. The salt and other particles are left behind. Reverse osmosis can remove almost all of the salt from seawater. It can also remove other contaminants such as viruses, bacteria, and organic chemicals. Reverse osmosis is more expensive than distillation, but it can remove more contaminants and requires less energy. Distillation is less expensive, but it removes fewer contaminants. In addition, distillation creates a lot of waste water (distillery effluent). Reverse osmosis produces little waste water. Reverse osmosis is being used in some communities in California to treat seawater for drinking. Reverse osmosis has been used in the Middle East and in the Caribbean. Reverse osmosis is also used to treat wastewater for reuse. Some people use reverse osmosis to purify their drinking water. Reverse osmosis does not remove fluoride from water. Some people add fluoride to their water to help prevent tooth decay. Reverse osmosis is not recommended for treating water with high levels of fluoride. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set limits on the amount of fluoride that can be in drinking water. Reverse osmosis can remove up to 95% of fluoride from water. If you are using reverse osmosis to treat water with high levels of fluoride, you may want to add fluoride to your water after treatment. If you want to add fluoride to your water, check with your local water supplier. They will let you know if the water already has enough fluoride or if you need to add fluoride.

    "question": "Why is multilevel marketing legal when it is clearly just a pyramid scheme ? I 've had like four people try to get me to participate in ambit energy and I just can not fathom how they are allowed to operate legally . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": ", an individual who buys a product or service from a direct seller of the product or service is also given the right to sell that same product or service. The individual then recruits other people to buy the product or service and to sell it, and the initial direct seller gets paid for each sale made by those recruited. This process continues until there are no more people to recruit. Multilevel marketing companies typically pay their direct sellers commissions based on the sales made by the people they recruit.

    "question": "Why light travel so fast , effortless and easy between places but for us to achieve theoretically that speed requires an enormous amount of energy . Random question , Do n't know if you guys can answer . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "ether (or ether) was once thought to be the medium through which light waves travel in space. The word \"ether\" comes from the Greek word \"h?ther,\" meaning \"air.\" In 1850, physicist James Clerk Maxwell showed that light is an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves travel through empty space. Maxwell also predicted that these waves must have some sort of medium to travel through. He called this medium \"ether.\" The idea of ether remained popular until the early 20th century, when Albert Einstein developed his special theory of relativity. This theory says that nothing can move faster than light. If there were an ether, then light would need to travel through it, which would mean it could not travel at its maximum speed. So, in order to maintain the speed of light as its maximum speed, Einstein concluded that there is no ether. Instead, he proposed that the speed of light is constant no matter how fast you are moving relative to the source of the light. In other words, the speed of light is constant in all reference frames. This is why light travels so fast between places, effortless and easy. The idea of ether remains a part of science fiction, such as Star Trek. However, we now know that there is no ether."

    "question": "Eil5 how md5sum s work How does the md5sum know if there are n't differences between things ? Even small ones ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "and b are the same size 100 bytes each so you can add them together to get a new byte array c with the same size as a and b 200 bytes total 3 ) c = a + b 4 ) The only thing that changes in c is the order of the bytes in a and b 5 ) Now what if you wanted to check if a and b are the same? You could just read all the bytes in c and see if they match a and b one by one. But that would be very slow! 6 ) Instead you can use a hash function to create a fixed length (256 bits) output for each input (a and b). This output is called a \"hash\" and it's unique for each input. So now instead of comparing all the bytes in c to a and b, we just compare the hash of c to the hash of a and b. 7 ) Here's an example of a hash function: md5sum 8 ) The hash function takes a byte array as input and outputs a fixed length (128 bits) output. 9 ) So now you can check if a and b are the same by just comparing their hashes instead of comparing all the bytes. 10 ) That's how the md5sum knows if there are no differences between things. Even small ones."

    "response": "that you have seen a doctor before. The doctor will ask about your childs symptoms and examine your child to find out what is causing the rash and blisters. The doctor may also do tests to rule out other conditions. The cause of this condition depends on whether your child has red bumps and blisters or just blisters. If your child has red bumps and blisters, the most common causes are: Bacterial infections such as impetigo and cellulitis. Impetigo is an infection of the skin that appears as blisters or sores that ooze fluid. Cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissue under the skin that appears as redness, warmth, and pain in the affected area. This infection can spread quickly if not treated. Viral infections such as hand, foot, and mouth disease, chickenpox, shingles, and viral warts. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common childhood illness that causes blisters on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and in the mouth. Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Shingles is a painful skin rash that occurs in people who have had chickenpox. It is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. Viral warts are small growths on the skin that look like a cauliflower. They are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Fungal infections such as ringworm. Ringworm is a fungal infection that appears as a round, red, scaly patch on the skin. Parasitic infections such as scabies. Scabies is an infestation of tiny mites that live in the skin's upper layer. These mites burrow into the skin to lay eggs. The mites' bites cause itching and a rash. Other causes include allergic reactions to: Foods such as peanuts, shellfish, and food additives. Medicines such as penicillin, tetracycline, and topical retinoids. Chemicals such as gasoline, paint thinners, and certain metals. Autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Autoimmune disorders occur when the bodys immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. In children, autoimmune disorders are rare. Inflammation caused by injury, burns, or poison ivy. Poison ivy is a plant that contains an oil called urushiol. The oil can cause an allergic reaction in some people. The reaction usually begins 12 to 36"

    "question": "What are the chances of recovery after having a brain hemorrhage due to fall?my grandfather fell down the stairs and had brain hemmorage on left side....he had brain surgery to relive the bleeding/pressure. the next day shows bleeding and stroke x2 on the right side. he s in ICU. He s been unconscious since the fall. is there any hope he can come out of this and be the grandfather I remember.",
    "response": "The chance that your grandfather will recover depends on how much of his brain was damaged by the bleeding and whether he has other medical problems. The chance of recovery is best when the bleeding is small and does not damage the brain. If your grandfather is able to get out of the ICU and go home, he may need help with daily activities such as dressing, bathing, and eating. He may need to go back to the hospital for treatment if his condition worsens or if he develops a serious infection. Your grandfather's doctors will check regularly to make sure that his brain is getting enough oxygen. They may use medicines to keep his blood pressure at a safe level. They also may give him medicine to prevent blood clots from forming in his blood vessels. Your grandfather may have trouble thinking, talking, seeing, walking, and remembering things. He may need physical, occupational, and speech therapy. He may need help taking care of himself. He may need to go back to the hospital if he needs more treatment. Some people who have had a brain hemorrhage recover completely. Others may live for only a few days or weeks. Others may live longer. It depends on the amount of damage done to the brain."

In men, UTIs often affect the prostate gland. The symptoms of UTIs include burning pain when urinating; increased frequency or urgency of urination; and/or cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine. The most common bacteria causing UTIs are Escherichia coli (E. coli), which normally lives in the intestines and can cause infection. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics. A urinary catheter (a tube inserted into the bladder) may be needed to relieve obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate gland or other problems. If your boyfriend has a UTI, he should drink plenty of fluids to help flush the bacteria out of his urinary tract. He should also urinate frequently, even if he doesn't feel the urge to do so. He shouldn't take over-the-counter pain medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen because they can make UTIs worse. He should avoid foods and drinks that might irritate his bladder, such as caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and acidic fruits. If he takes medications for allergies, asthma, or high blood pressure, these might cause UTIs. He should check with his doctor to see if he needs to change his medication. A UTI is not a sign of an STD. However, some STDs can cause symptoms similar to those of a UTI, including painful urination, frequent urination, and a burning sensation during urination. STDs can cause infections in the urinary tract, but the infections aren't usually bacterial. If your boyfriend has a UTI, he should call his doctor to get it checked out. He shouldn't assume that the problem is a UTI unless his doctor says so. He should also get tested for STDs if he hasn't been tested recently."

    "response": "It's not that there aren't USB 3.0 ports on new computers, it's just that USB 3.0 isn't backwards compatible with USB 2.0 devices. This means you can't plug in a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 port and have it work. It's possible to get a USB 3.0 adapter, which will allow you to plug in a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 port, but it's not necessary for most people. There's no reason to put USB 1.1 or USB 2.0 ports on a computer, since USB 3.0 is backwards compatible with both of those standards. USB 3.0 is backwards compatible with USB 1.1 because it uses the same connector and cable. USB 3.0 is backwards compatible with USB 2.0 because it uses the same connector and cable. USB 3.0 is faster than USB 2.0 because it uses more data transfer channels. USB 3.0 has 4 data transfer channels while USB 2.0 has 2. USB 3.0 has a maximum data transfer rate of 5 Gbps (gigabits per second) while USB 2.0 has a maximum data transfer rate of 480 Mbps (megabits per second). The main difference between USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 is that USB 3.0 can transfer more data at once. This means that USB 3.0 can transfer files and other types of data faster than USB 2.0. USB 3.0 also has better power management, which means that USB 3.0 ports can provide more power to devices that need it. This means that USB 3.0 ports can charge devices like smartphones and tablets more quickly.

    "response": "(NSFW)The color of your pubic hair is determined by the type of melanin in your body. Melanin is the pigment that gives your skin and hair its color. The amount of melanin in your body determines whether you have dark or light hair. Blondes and redheads have lighter versions of the same type of melanin as brunettes. Blondes and redheads have less of this type of melanin in their bodies than brunettes. Blondes and redheads are more likely to have a different type of melanin called pheomelanin in their bodies.

    "response": "The difference between pants and skirts was based on how the clothes were made. Men's clothing was made from one piece of cloth that went from the shoulders to the ankles. Women's clothing was made from two pieces of cloth that were sewn together at the sides. The first women's skirts were made from animal skins or plant leaves. They were cut into a long strip and then sewn together at the sides. The strip was then folded over the hips and tied around the waist. The first pants were made from animal hides. They were cut into a long strip and then sewn together at the waist. The strips were then folded over the legs and tied around the ankles. Over time, people learned to make clothes from different materials such as wool and cotton. Clothes were made from one piece of cloth for both men and women. People wore long dresses that covered the feet. The dresses were often very short and could be easily pulled up. Women wore loose-fitting dresses with a large skirt. The dresses were not very form-fitting. Men wore loose-fitting pants that were similar to modern-day pants. Men wore loose-fitting shirts and coats. The shirts and coats were not very form-fitting. Clothes were also made from two pieces of cloth that were sewn together at the sides. This is the type of clothing we wear today. Pants are made from one piece of cloth. Skirts are made from two pieces of cloth. Clothes were made from one piece of cloth for both men and women. Clothes were worn to cover the body and keep it warm.

    "question": "How have Spain and Greece 's unemployment rates gotten so high ? The unemployment rates are as high as some of the poorest places in the world . I ca n't understand why that is happening in developed economies . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The unemployment rate in Greece is 16%, and the unemployment rate in Spain is 24%. The unemployment rate is the percentage of people who are out of work. This chart shows how many people are unemployed in each country. It also shows how many people are working and how many are not working but looking for work. In both countries, the number of people who are working has stayed the same for a long time. The number of people who are not working but looking for work has gone up a lot. This means that there are more people who need jobs than there are jobs to go around. There are a lot of reasons why the unemployment rate in Spain and Greece is so high. One reason is that the countries had a big problem with their money. They borrowed a lot of money from other countries, but they did not pay it back. So now they can't borrow any more money. Another reason is that the two countries have lots of old buildings. Many of these buildings do not have electricity or water. So when people lose their jobs, they can't find new jobs building new houses. Instead, they try to fix the old buildings. But they don't know how to fix them. So they can't build new ones. And even if they could, they can't sell them because people won't buy them. This makes it hard to make money. Another reason is that the two countries have too many workers for the number of jobs. So the workers have to look for work in other countries. Some of them leave the countries. Others stay and look for work in other ways."

    "question": "How do submarines withstand so much water pressure ? Man has reached 7 - mile ocean depth . How does a machine withstand that much pressure ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Undersea explorers have found that the deeper they dive, the greater the pressure on their bodies. If you were to hold your breath while swimming in a pool, you would feel the same pressure as if you were at the bottom of the ocean. This is because the pressure of the water increases with depth. If you want to see how deep you can go underwater without feeling any pain, you can use this experiment to find out. To test how deep you can go underwater, first you need to determine the pressure of the water at different depths. You can use the following formula to find the pressure: P = F / A P = pressure F = force A = area The formula for force is F = m g F = force m = mass g = gravity The formula for area is A = l x w A = area l = length w = width Now you can find the pressure at different depths. For example, if you wanted to find the pressure at 5 feet underwater, you would use the following formula: P = (m x g) / (l x w) P = ((1 x 32.2) / (5 x 5)) = 1.28 pounds per square inch (psi) So the pressure at 5 feet underwater is 1.28 psi. Now you can find the pressure at different depths. The table below shows the pressure at different depths. As you can see, the pressure increases as you go deeper into the water. You can also see that the pressure at 100 feet underwater is 43.7 psi, which is greater than the pressure at the surface of the ocean. This means that you can't hold your breath underwater and still breathe when you reach 100 feet underwater. The pressure at 100 feet underwater is 43.7 psi, which is greater than the pressure at the surface of the ocean. This means that you can't hold your breath underwater and still breathe when you reach 100 feet underwater."

    "response": "Knitting creates warmth by trapping air between the loops of yarn. When you wear knitted items, the air is trapped inside the fabric, keeping your body warm. The more loops of yarn there are, the better the insulating effect. The air also helps to wick moisture away from your skin and keep you dry."

    "response": "It's a good question. The reason we don't see many people using these technologies in real life is that they're not as simple or effective as some people think. There are lots of ways to purify water, but they all require some kind of energy input - electricity, fuel, or human labor. And if you need to use energy to purify water, then you also need a power source and storage for the purified water. In many places around the world, there just isn't enough money to build these kinds of systems. Plus, even if you can afford to build a system, there are often other problems. For example, the systems may be hard to maintain because they're too complicated, or they may use too much energy. Or they may break down and stop working when you least expect it. So while some of these purification technologies are very good at what they do, they're not always practical to use in real life."

    "response": "The Voting Rights Act was originally enacted in 1965 to protect voting rights for African Americans who had been denied the right to vote under Jim Crow laws in many southern states. Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act requires that states with a history of voter discrimination must get federal approval before changing their election laws. The law is called the \"preclearance\" requirement because the federal government has to \"clear\" any proposed change in voting laws before they can go into effect. The Supreme Court has ruled that the preclearance requirement is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's ruling is based on the fact that the law has been successful at protecting voting rights for over 50 years. The Court says that the law should be replaced with a more modern way of identifying states that need help with voting rights. The Court does not say that the law is no longer needed, just that it should be changed. The law still applies to states that have not passed any changes in voting laws since 2006. It also applies to states that have not asked for federal preapproval of any voting changes."

    "question": "Why do bigger muscles ( usually ) allow you to lift more weight ? I understand that muscle size is n't totally responsible for strength but I do n't understand why exactly we get bigger muscles when we lift or how they affect our strength . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The reason that bigger muscles usually allow you to lift more weight is because bigger muscles have more muscle fibers. Muscle fibers are the basic building blocks of muscles. Each muscle fiber has a tiny nucleus in it. The nucleus is where the muscle fiber gets its instructions from. A nucleus is also called a cell nucleus. Muscle fibers are like little factories where energy is made. When you exercise, your body makes more energy and more muscle fibers work together to make the muscle contract. This contraction allows you to lift weights. If you have more muscle fibers working together, you can lift more weight. Muscle fibers are also called muscle cells."

    "question": "Why do humans perceive logarithmically ? Sound and light intensity for instance . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When you hear a sound or see an image, your brain interprets the information that comes in through the ears or eyes as something meaningful. Your brain does not just \"see\" the image or \"hear\" the sound. Instead, it uses its knowledge of the world to interpret what it sees or hears. The brain is able to make sense of the information from the senses because the senses send information to the brain using a code based on numbers. For example, when you look at a picture, you may see 20 different colors in the picture. However, the color red is the same color no matter where in the picture you look at it. The brain knows that all the red areas in the picture are the same color. Similarly, when you listen to a sound, you may hear many different pitches. However, the pitch of a particular tone is the same pitch no matter where in the picture you hear it. The brain knows that all the tones with the same pitch are the same pitch. The brain also knows that the pitch of a particular tone increases as you move from left to right along the picture. The brain can use this information to figure out where the tone is coming from. This ability to interpret the information from the senses is called perception . The brain receives information from the senses and makes sense of it. Perception is important because it allows us to understand what we see and hear. The brain also uses its knowledge of the world to help make sense of what it sees and hears. For example, if you look at a picture of a cat, your brain will know that the picture represents a cat even though it looks different from the real cat. If you hear a sound, your brain will know what it is even if the sound is distorted. The brain also uses its knowledge of the world to make sense of what it sees and hears.

    "response": "The Federal Reserve System is one of the most important pieces of our government. It's a lot like a bank for banks. The Federal Reserve is made up of 12 regional banks that work together to make sure all banks have enough money to operate. The Federal Reserve also has a central office in Washington D.C. where they make decisions about the money supply. When you buy something with your parents' money, you're borrowing from the bank. When you pay back the loan, you're repaying the bank. The Federal Reserve makes sure the banks have enough money to lend to people who need it. This helps keep the economy healthy. If you think about it, the Federal Reserve is like the \"banker's bank\" because it has a lot of power over the money supply. There are two main reasons why many people believe the Federal Reserve should be abolished. First, the Federal Reserve is run by the government. Second, the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling the money supply. Many people believe the Federal Reserve should be abolished because: - The Federal Reserve is run by the government. The Federal Reserve was created by Congress to serve as the central bank of the United States. But many people don't agree with how the Federal Reserve operates. Some think the Federal Reserve should be more independent from the government. - The Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling the money supply. The Federal Reserve can control the money supply by buying and selling bonds. Buying bonds increases the money supply, and selling bonds decreases the money supply. Some people think the Federal Reserve should not control the money supply. They believe that the money supply should be left up to the free market."

    "response": "Orgasm : The brain sends messages to the muscles of the pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles to contract. These contractions create the feeling of pleasure. They also stimulate the release of chemicals that help the body relax. The release of these chemicals is part of what causes orgasms. Orgasms may feel good for a few seconds or up to 10 minutes after the orgasm. Orgasms can cause other symptoms, such as: - A rush of blood to the face and neck - Sweating - Tremors - Vomiting - Shivering - Dizziness - Paresthesia (feeling like pins and needles) - Tingling - Paradoxical muscle relaxation in certain areas - Loss of bladder control - Loss of bowel control - Loss of consciousness. Orgasms can also cause pain in some people. This pain can be felt in the vagina, penis, scrotum, rectum, anus, or nearby tissues. Pain during orgasm may be caused by conditions such as: - Vaginismus - Pelvic inflammatory disease - Infection of the urinary tract - Infection of the genital tract - Cancer of the reproductive organs - Endometriosis - Prostatitis.

    "response": "The human body needs calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Calcium also helps the body make hormones and keeps muscles and nerves working well. Many foods contain calcium, including dairy products, leafy green vegetables, fish, beans, nuts, and seeds. People who don't eat enough calcium-rich foods can get it from supplements or fortified foods, such as orange juice, cereals, breads, and soy beverages. A person's body makes some of the calcium needed for good health, but only a small amount. Most of the calcium in the body is stored in the bones and teeth. The rest is used for many other important functions. The human body uses calcium to help: Build and maintain strong bones and teeth. Keep muscles and nerves working well. Control blood pressure. Help keep your heart beating normally. Help prevent osteoporosis, a disease that weakens bones and causes them to break easily. Help keep blood sugar levels normal. Prevent constipation. Prevent kidney stones. Milk and milk products are excellent sources of calcium. They also provide other nutrients that are important for growth and development. For example, milk is an excellent source of protein, which is important for building and repairing tissues. It is also a good source of phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin B12, riboflavin, niacin, and potassium. The table below shows the calcium content of common dairy foods. It also shows the number of servings in each food item. The recommended daily intake (RDI) of calcium for adults age 9 and older is 1,000 mg. For those age 14 and older, the RDI is 1,200 mg. The RDI is the amount of a nutrient needed to meet the needs of most healthy people. It may be higher for people who are pregnant or nursing, older than 70 years old, or have certain medical conditions. The RDI is also called the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).

    "question": "Why does the calculation for IRR use revenue, not profit?",
    "response": "The NPV method uses cash flows to discount the value of future cash flows to present values. Discounting is the process of determining the present value of a future sum of money, given a specified rate of return. NPV is calculated as the sum of the present values of the costs and benefits over the duration of the project or investment. If the NPV is positive, the investment's profits exceed its costs, making it profitable. If the NPV is negative, the investment's costs exceed its profits, making it unprofitable. If the NPV is zero, the investment's profits equal its costs, making it neither profitable nor unprofitable. Discounting is used to determine the present value of future cash flows. The formula for NPV is: NPV = CF1/(1+r) + CF2/(1+r)2 + CF3/(1+r)3 + ... + CFn/(1+r)n where: - NPV is the net present value of the project - CFi is the net cash flow in period i - r is the discount rate (the opportunity cost of capital) - n is the number of periods - the formula assumes that all cash flows occur at the end of each period. For example, if an investment has a cost of $100,000 and generates a net cash flow of $50,000 per year for five years, with a discount rate of 10%, the NPV would be: NPV = $50,000/(1+0.1) + $50,000/(1+0.1)2 + $50,000/(1+0.1)3 + $50,000/(1+0.1)4 + $50,000/(1+0.1)5 = $50,000/1.1 + $50,000/1.21 + $50,000/1.331 + $50,000/1.4641 + $50,000/1.6105 = $45,454.55 + $41,322.29 + $37,565.71 + $34,150.64 + $31,045.13 = $189,5"

    "response": "The roof of your mouth is called the palate. It's made up of bones and cartilage that form a roof over your mouth. The roof of your mouth is divided into two parts: hard palate and soft palate. - The hard palate is the back part of the roof of your mouth. - The soft palate is the front part of the roof of your mouth. The hard palate separates your mouth from your nose. The soft palate separates your mouth from your throat. , What Are the Functions of the Hard and Soft Palates? , The hard palate has several important functions. It helps you chew food, swallow, and taste. When you chew with your teeth, the hard palate helps hold the food in place so you can grind it with your molars (back teeth). The hard palate also helps keep food out of your nose and prevents choking. The soft palate helps you breathe, talk, and swallow. When you breathe through your mouth, the soft palate helps keep air from going into your nose. If you have a cold or allergies, your soft palate may swell, which can cause a stuffy nose. Swelling can make it harder to breathe through your nose. The soft palate also helps you make certain sounds when you talk. , What Is Tongue Cancer?, The tongue is a muscular organ that helps you chew, taste, and swallow. The tongue also helps you talk.

    "response": "The Earth is tilted on its axis. The tilt is at a fixed angle to the sun so that in winter the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The Northern Hemisphere gets less direct sunlight and is therefore colder. The same thing happens in summer but in reverse. The Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The Southern Hemisphere gets less direct sunlight and is therefore colder. This means that the coldest days of the year are when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun during the winter solstice and the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. It is only when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun that the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. This happens in the summer solstice. So the coldest days of the year are always after the winter solstice."

    "response": "The risk of contracting an infection from feces or urine is very low. The bacteria found in these fluids (such as E.coli) do not survive well in the environment for long periods of time. In addition, most healthy people have normal immune systems that prevent them from getting sick from these bacteria. However, people with weakened immune systems may be at higher risk for infection from these bacteria. If you are concerned about your health, contact your doctor. The best way to protect yourself against infection is to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after coming into contact with bodily fluids."

    "question": "Would it be possible to mine a white dwarf star ? I actually joined reddit to ask this question , could n't find the answer online . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "white dwarf star is very dense and has a very strong gravity, so mining would be very difficult. Also, if the white dwarf star is not too close to Earth, it will appear to be a very bright star in the night sky. This may cause problems with astronomy, as astronomers may have trouble observing other stars and planets. Also, white dwarfs are very hot, so they can burn up people and equipment that come near them. In addition, white dwarfs can be very dangerous because of their strong gravity. The gravity of a white dwarf can pull objects towards it and make them fall into the star. This can damage or destroy mining equipment. It can also cause accidents when people try to climb onto the surface of the white dwarf. In addition, a white dwarf can have very high temperatures. If the temperature of a white dwarf is very high, then it can heat up mining equipment. This can make it difficult to mine the white dwarf because the equipment can melt.

    "response": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a commercial urine test for the detection of creatinine in urine. The study included 100 randomly selected urine samples that were obtained from patients at a local hospital. The samples were tested using both the commercial urine test and a standard laboratory method. The results of the two tests were compared to determine the accuracy of the commercial urine test. The study found that the commercial urine test had a false negative rate of 5%, which means that out of every 20 samples tested, 1 sample would be incorrectly identified as not containing creatinine. This is an important finding because it suggests that the commercial urine test may not be as accurate as expected. The study also found that the commercial urine test had a false positive rate of 10%, which means that out of every 10 samples tested, 1 sample would be incorrectly identified as containing creatinine.

    "response": "Well, I think you've asked for more than one question here, but I'll give you an answer to each one. First, I don't know how much money GE pays in taxes because I haven't looked at their financial statements. Second, I think that the numbers you quote (4.2%) are correct. Third, I think that GE's tax situation is complicated and not simple. Fourth, I think that GE's tax situation is legal. Fifth, I think that GE's tax situation is fair. Sixth, I think that GE's tax situation is a good example of the problems with our current tax system. Here are my answers to these questions: - I don't know how much money GE pays in taxes because I haven't looked at their financial statements. - I think that the numbers you quote (4.2%) are correct. - I think that GE's tax situation is complicated and not simple. - I think that GE's tax situation is legal. - I think that GE's tax situation is fair. - I think that GE's tax situation is a good example of the problems with our current tax system. First, I don't know how much money GE pays in taxes because I haven't looked at their financial statements. This is a good thing! I don't want to look at the financial statements of big companies like General Electric because they are complicated and I don't understand them. The financial statements show what a company has earned and what it has spent. They also show how much money the company has on hand. The financial statements tell us how much money a company owes its creditors. The financial statements also tell us what a company owns. These are important things to know. But, I don't think that we need to know exactly how much money GE pays in taxes. We can get a general idea of how much money GE pays in taxes from its tax return. This is the form that a company must file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This is the form that the IRS uses to determine how much tax a company must pay. If a company does not file a tax return, the IRS will send the company a notice telling it that it must file a tax return. The IRS will also send the company a bill asking the company to pay the amount of tax that the IRS believes that the company owes. A company must file a tax return if it has any income or if it has any assets (such as property) that are worth more than $5,000. A company must file"

    "question": "Mac \" Tubo Boost \" . Why ca n't they just keep that faster processor speed at all times ? For example , 2.4 Ghz can turbo boost up to 2.9 Ghz Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "computer is a device that processes information. The microprocessor is the part of the computer that performs calculations and logic operations. When you turn on your computer, the microprocessor runs at its base clock speed, which is the speed at which it runs without any additional power. For example, if your computer has a 1.6 GHz (gigahertz) processor, the microprocessor runs at 1.6 billion cycles per second. If your computer has a 2.4 GHz processor, the microprocessor runs at 2.4 billion cycles per second. 3. When you enable Turbo Boost, your computer's microprocessor temporarily increases its clock speed to a higher speed for short periods of time. This allows your computer to perform more tasks in less time, which makes your computer run faster. 4. You can enable Turbo Boost only when the following conditions are met: - Your computer's microprocessor supports Turbo Boost technology. - Your computer's microprocessor has sufficient power to support the increased speed. - Your computer's operating system supports Turbo Boost technology. 5. When your computer's microprocessor is running at a higher speed, the amount of electricity it uses increases. 6. When your computer's microprocessor is running at a higher speed, it may produce more heat than it does when it's running at its base clock speed. 7. If your computer's microprocessor runs at a higher speed, the fans and cooling systems inside your computer may run more frequently and louder than usual. 8. If your computer's microprocessor runs at a higher speed, the battery in your laptop computer may drain more quickly than usual. 9. If your computer's microprocessor runs at a higher speed, you may experience more frequent or severe vibrations. 10. If your computer's microprocessor runs at a higher speed, your computer may not be able to run some programs. 11. If you have a computer with multiple processors, you may not be able to enable Turbo Boost for all of the processors. 12. If you have a computer with multiple processors, the processors may not run at the same speed while Turbo Boost is enabled. 13.

    "response": "is the most modern understanding of human evolution / origin . We know that humans and Neanderthals were separate species that lived at the same time. Neanderthals are not considered our direct ancestors. They are thought to have gone extinct about 30,000 years ago. But they did leave their mark on the human gene pool. We still carry some of their genes. For example, Neanderthals had a gene that helps with making vitamin D. This gene is found in 90% of people living outside of Africa today. We also have some Neanderthal DNA in our own genes. The amount varies from person to person. Some people have more than others. Researchers think this may have happened when Neanderthals and humans mated. But there is no evidence that humans and Neanderthals interbred. There are many theories about why Neanderthals went extinct. One theory says that humans outcompeted them for resources. Another says that humans killed them off. But one thing is certain: Neanderthals didn't evolve into humans. We evolved separately. We are a different species."

    "response": "I think you might be thinking of a \"reading process\" for hearing people. Deaf people learn to read in a different way. They use their eyes to look at the words on the page and their hands to feel the vibrations from the book as they turn the pages. Then they use their fingers to trace along the lines of letters and numbers. As they trace the lines with their finger they can hear the words in their mind. It's just like the way you see your mother or father read the words out loud. You don't need to hear them to know what they mean. It is called tactile reading. The word \"tactile\" means using your sense of touch. The fingers feel the paper and the vibrations from the book as it turns the pages. Tactile reading is used by many deaf people. They use it to learn new things and to help them remember information. It is also used by some blind people."

    "question": "Why Do People Fear Darkness ? I believe it 's not a natural thing because we spend our first months in total darkness . Is it our imagination , insecurity or something else ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "- the human body is made to be active during the day and rest at night. Our ancestors needed to be awake and active during the day so they could find food and protect themselves from predators. They also needed to sleep at night when there was no light. However, many people today work during the night and sleep during the day. This can disrupt their circadian rhythms, which are the body's internal clock that regulates many functions, such as sleep, body temperature, and hormone release. Circadian rhythms are also affected by changes in the environment, such as artificial light. The circadian rhythm of some animals is affected by light-dark cycles, but not all animals need light to stay active. for example, bats and owls are nocturnal animals. They hunt at night and rest during the day. Some fish are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day and rest at night. Many other animals are crepuscular, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk. These animals have adapted to be active during times when it is not completely dark. Some animals are even active at night without any external light source. For example, fireflies use a chemical reaction in their bodies to produce light called bioluminescence. Fireflies use bioluminescence to communicate with other fireflies and to attract mates. for more information about circadian rhythms, go to the following link: How Does Light Affect Our Bodies? - circadian rhythms are important to many bodily functions. They regulate things like sleep, hormone production, and body temperature. circadian rhythms can also affect mood, behavior, and alertness. circadian rhythms are disrupted by light exposure at night. circadian rhythms are affected by artificial light sources, such as light bulbs, computer screens, and televisions. circadian rhythms are also affected by the seasons. circadian rhythms may also be affected by jet lag, which occurs when a person travels across time zones. circadian rhythms may also be affected by certain medications and medical conditions. for more information about circadian rhythms, go to the following link: Sleep - Sleep is an important part of good health. Sleep helps you grow and stay healthy. It also helps you think clearly and manage stress, anger, and sadness. Sleep helps your body repair itself and prepare for the next day. Sleep helps you learn and remember new information. Sleep helps you control your moods. Sleep also helps you get along with others. Sleep is important for mental health.

    "response": "sprinters have been able to run shorter and faster than they did in the past. This has happened because of better training methods, nutrition, and equipment. The fastest runners now can go from 10 meters to 60 meters in less time than it took the fastest runners in the 1950s to go from 10 meters to 20 meters. In other words, today's sprinters run faster and farther in the same amount of time as they did before. The top sprinters in the world now can reach speeds of over 10 meters per second (36 kilometers per hour) in 10 meters and 20 meters. This is faster than a cheetah running at top speed!"

Thanks",
    "response": "Coughing up blood is not normal in a child. It can be a sign of a serious condition. Coughing up blood could be caused by: Bronchitis A lung infection that can cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever. Pneumonia A lung infection that can cause coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever. Foreign body A small piece of food or other object that gets stuck in the airway. This can cause coughing and choking. Bronchiolitis An inflammation of the small airways of the lungs. It is usually caused by a viral infection. It most commonly affects children younger than 2 years of age. Asthma An ongoing (chronic) disease that causes inflammation of the airways. The airways become sensitive to irritants such as smoke, dust, and pollen. The airways may then react to these irritants by narrowing, causing breathing problems. The airways also produce excess mucus. The mucus coats the airways and makes it hard to breathe. Bronchospasm A sudden tightening of the muscles around the airways. It causes a severe cough and wheezing. Croup A viral infection that causes a barking cough, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing. Who Is at Risk? Anyone can get bronchitis, pneumonia, foreign body aspiration, bronchiolitis, asthma, or croup. However, certain groups of people are at higher risk. These include: Infants and young children People older than 65 years People who smoke or have a family history of lung disease People who live or work in polluted areas People who have allergies or weakened immune systems People who take medicines that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy drugs, and immunosuppressive drugs (drugs that weaken the immune system) People who have chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or obesity. What Are the Signs and Symptoms? Coughing up blood may be a symptom of many diseases and conditions. It can also be a side effect of certain medicines. For example, it can be a side effect of aspirin. The symptoms of coughing up blood depend on the cause. The following are the most common signs and symptoms of coughing up blood. They are described below. Coughing up blood can cause you to cough up blood-tinged or bloody sputum (phlegm). Sputum is the mixture of saliva and mucus"

The argument goes as follows: If the witness is telling the truth, he or she would have no reason not to tell the truth. If the witness is not telling the truth, then he or she has no reason to believe that he or she will be punished for lying, since he or she will already be punished for committing the crime in question. In other words, if the witness is lying, he or she is already guilty of the crime, so there's no reason to lie about it. Thus, the witness cannot be lying because he or she cannot be guilty.

    "question": "Many OTC medicines are advertised as \" maximum strength . \" Are there situations where \" maximum strength \" is unhelpful or even harmful compared to lower dosages ? Or do OTC drugs tend to be so safe that \" maximum \" is relatively low ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "\"Maximum strength\" can mean different things for different products. For some products, it means the highest amount of medicine that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that product. For other products, \"maximum strength\" may mean the highest amount of medicine that the manufacturer thinks is safe for use in most people. The FDA does not allow any drug to be sold with a higher dose than what has been approved for the product. If you take more than the recommended dose, you may experience side effects, such as stomach upset, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, or allergic reactions. You should never take more than the amount recommended on the label or as directed by your doctor. Some over-the-counter (OTC) cold medicines have ingredients that may cause serious health problems if they are used in combination with certain prescription medicines. For example, some cold medicines contain acetaminophen (a pain reliever), which may interact with prescription pain medicines such as codeine or morphine. Using these medicines together can cause liver damage. The FDA requires that all OTC cold medicines contain warnings about acetaminophen on the label. The warnings also state that you should not take more than one cold medicine at a time because of the risk of overdose from acetaminophen. Always read the label carefully before taking any medication. If you have questions about how much medicine to take, ask your doctor or pharmacist."

    "response": "EST stands for Eastern Standard Time and is used in many parts of the United States to tell what time it is in those areas. It is the standard time zone for the eastern two-thirds of the United States. The eastern time zone is called EST because it is one hour behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). is used to show that the program starts at a certain time in the eastern time zone. This means that if you are in an area that uses EST, you will have to set your clock back one hour to watch the program. This is important because some programs may start earlier than you think they do if you are not aware of the time zone difference. Also, if you live in an area that does not use EST, you will have to set your clock forward one hour to watch the program. This is because the program will start earlier than it would if you were in an area that uses EST."

    "response": "The common causes of food allergies are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts (such as walnuts, pecans, and almonds), fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat. A food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs when the body mistakes a protein in a food or something derived from a food for a harmful invader. The immune system responds by producing antibodies to fight the \"invader.\" These antibodies trigger a cascade of chemicals that can cause allergic symptoms. The most common signs and symptoms of a food allergy are hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and eczema. In severe cases, food allergies can cause anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening condition in which the person goes into shock. Anaphylaxis can occur within minutes of eating the offending food or can take up to several hours. If you think your child has a food allergy, you should see a doctor. He or she will probably ask about your child's diet, review any reactions to foods, and perform skin or blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor may recommend avoiding the offending food. If this happens, your child will need to read food labels carefully. He or she also needs to be aware of foods that contain traces of the allergen and avoid them. For example, some sauces and gravies contain ingredients derived from milk or egg whites. If you suspect that your child has a food allergy, talk with his or her doctor. Your doctor will help you decide whether your child should avoid the offending food. If your child has a severe reaction to a food, he or she may need to carry an epinephrine auto-injector (such as EpiPen). This device can deliver a dose of medicine that will save your child's life. Your child's doctor will teach you how to use this device. You should carry the epinephrine auto-injector at all times and have other people know how to use it in case you are not able to administer it yourself."

    "response": "The idea of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is one of the cornerstones of our legal system. The concept of innocence means that you're not guilty of a crime unless you're found guilty after a fair trial. This doesn't mean that you're not guilty; it simply means that you haven't been found guilty. In order to be found guilty, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the crime. A jury of 12 people listens to evidence and testimony about the crime and decides whether the prosecution has met its burden of proof. The jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned unless new evidence emerges or a higher court rules that the original trial was unfair. The law also says that the accused person must be present at the trial and have an attorney to help him or her understand what's happening. If a person can't afford an attorney, the government will provide one for him or her. If you're found guilty, you'll be sentenced. This sentence may be probation, community service, fines, or even imprisonment. You'll also be required to pay for any damage you caused. The idea of \"innocent until proven guilty\" applies to everyone in our country, including those who have been convicted of crimes. The only difference is that if someone is found guilty, he or she has to live with the consequences of the conviction. Those consequences include paying fines and/or serving time in prison. If someone is found not guilty, he or she goes on with life as if nothing ever happened."

    "question": "Why do female dogs hump things when they 're in heat , even though that 's not really how ... it works ? Mine humps her bed vigorously and shamelessly , for example . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "sexual. The female dog is in heat (estrus) only once a year, but the male dog is always interested. A female dog will mount other dogs or objects to try to stimulate an interest in her from the male dog. If she is not interested, she may continue to mount until she becomes tired. When a female dog is in heat, she may become very affectionate and want to be held all the time. She may also show some changes in behavior, such as increased vocalization or restlessness. This is all normal. The best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy is to spay your female dog before she has her first heat. Spaying eliminates the chance of unwanted pregnancies and the health risks associated with them. It also eliminates the heat cycle and the behavior problems that come with it.

    "question": "What is my body doing when drop off a roller coaster to give me that \" feeling \" in my stomach ? Right when you go off a drop your body gives you that \" droppy feeling \" and I was wondering - what causes that ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The sensation you feel as you go down the drop of a roller coaster is called nausea. Nausea can be caused by motion sickness. Motion sickness happens when your inner ear senses movement but your eyes do not. Your brain receives conflicting messages about what's happening, so it gets confused. When this happens, your body reacts by making you feel nauseated. The inner ear contains tiny hairs that move around with the head. These hairs send signals to the brain about how the head and body are moving. The eyes also sense movement. If you're sitting still and looking at something that's moving, such as a car driving by, your eyes will tell your brain that you're not moving even though your body feels like it's moving. The difference between what your eyes see and what your body feels makes you feel dizzy or nauseous. The same thing happens on a roller coaster. You may feel nauseous because you don't know whether you're actually moving or if you're just looking at things that are moving. Roller coasters have lots of drops, twists, turns, and other movements. This makes it hard for your brain to know whether you're really moving or just looking at things that are moving. You may feel nauseous if the ride moves too fast, too slow, or up and down. You may also feel nauseous if you're in the back seat of the roller coaster. This is because the back seat doesn't move as much as the front seats do. If you're sitting in the front seat, you may feel more secure, which can make you less likely to feel nauseous. Roller coasters can make you feel nauseous even if you've never had motion sickness before. If you get sick, you may feel sick for a few minutes or hours after you get off the roller coaster. You can avoid getting nauseous by sitting in the front seat and watching the ride through the window."

    "question": "How are paintings and artworks appraised and what makes some contemporary artworks more valuable than another ? Also , can an artist knowingly influence the value of his work ? EDIT : Thanks for your replies . I really learned a lot ! :) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "There are two ways to appraise a painting or artwork. The first is through a professional appraiser who will examine the painting or artwork in person and give you an estimate based on their experience and knowledge of the subject. The second is through a web site such as Artsy.net which uses a variety of factors to determine the value of the painting or artwork. An example of one of these factors is \"Provenance\". Provenance refers to the history of ownership of a work of art. This can include information about the previous owners and where the painting was exhibited. Another factor is \"Condition\". Condition is the state of preservation of the painting or artwork. The condition can affect the value of the painting or artwork. If the painting has been damaged or repaired, it may be worth less money than if it were in pristine condition. An artist can try to make his work more valuable by creating it in a way that makes it look older or more important. For example, he can create the painting using old techniques or use materials that look like they're from an earlier time. He could also create the painting to look like it was created by someone famous. He could also make it look like the painting has been damaged or repaired. These things can make the painting look more valuable and therefore make it worth more money."

    "question": "Why does hair curl ? More specifically , why does hair differ from person to person ? Some people have completely straight hair while some people have incredibly curly hair . What makes this happen ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Hair is a fibrous protein called keratin that is formed in the epidermis of the skin. Keratin is produced by specialized cells called keratinocytes. These cells are located in the hair follicle, which is the part of the skin where hair grows. The hair shaft (the visible part of the hair) is made up of tightly packed layers of keratinized cells. The hair follicle also contains a supply of blood vessels and nerve endings. 2. The shape of hair is determined by the genes inherited from both parents. 3. The color of hair is determined by the presence or absence of melanin, a pigment that can be brown, black, red, blond, or white. Melanin is produced by specialized cells called melanocytes. 4. The texture of hair is determined by the thickness of the hair shaft and the way it is curled. The thickness of the hair shaft is influenced by the number of cells added to each new hair shaft as the hair grows. The amount of melanin in the hair is also important in determining the texture of hair. 5. The way hair curls is determined by the way the hair shafts are arranged within the hair follicles. The arrangement of hair shafts determines how curly or straight the hair appears. The way hair shafts are arranged is determined by the genes inherited from both parents."

    "question": "Why do fountain drinks at different restaurants taste different ? McDonald 's , Burger King and Zaxby 's all have the Coke Freestyle , but a Sprite at each one tastes completely different from each other . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The first step in making a Coke or Sprite drink is to make sure that the bottle of Coke or Sprite is fresh. If it's not, the flavor will be affected. A second step is to add the syrup. The syrup for Coke and Sprite is made from different ingredients and has a different concentration of sugar. This means that the syrup for Coke and Sprite has a different taste. The third step is to mix the syrup with the water. The amount of water used also affects the taste. The fourth step is to add flavoring. Coke has caramel flavoring while Sprite has orange flavoring. The fifth step is to add caffeine. The amount of caffeine varies between Coke and Sprite. The final step is to put the cap on the bottle. This seals the bottle so that the flavors don't change. The reason why the same drink tastes different at different restaurants is because the process of making the drink is different. At McDonald's, the soda comes in bottles that are kept in a cold room. The soda is mixed with the syrup and water right before you order your drink. At Burger King, the soda comes in bottles that are kept in a cold room. The soda is mixed with the syrup and water right before you order your drink. At Zaxby's, the soda comes in bottles that are kept in a cold room.

    "question": "Defamation laws and Free speech , how are they different ? Sorry for the dumb question , but I see individuals or entities get sued yet we have free speech ( or do we ? ) . I live in Canada . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The right to free expression is an important part of our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, it does not mean that you can say anything you want, whenever you want. The law protects freedom of expression, but it also limits it. For example, if you make a false statement about someone's character, conduct or reputation, it may be defamatory. Defamation is the act of making a false statement about someone's character, conduct or reputation that harms that person's reputation. Defamation is a civil wrong and is not a criminal offence. If you're found guilty of defamation, the court will decide how much money you must pay to the person who was harmed. The person who was harmed may ask for damages. A defamatory statement can be made in writing, in a picture, or through spoken words. The person who says something defamatory is called the defamer. The person who was harmed is called the victim. If the defamer is a public figure or a private individual, the victim can sue him or her for damages. A private individual is someone who is not a public figure. A public figure is someone who has gained national or international attention because of his or her actions, work, or other activities. Examples of public figures include politicians, athletes, entertainers, and celebrities. If the defamer is a public figure, the victim must prove that he or she knew or should have known that what he or she said was false. The victim doesn't need to prove this if the defamer is a private individual. The victim must also show that the defamer acted with malice or with intent to harm the victim. Malice means the defamer intended to harm the victim. If the defamer is a private individual, the victim must only show that the defamer acted with negligence or with gross negligence. Negligence means the defamer did not take reasonable care to avoid harming the victim. Gross negligence means the defamer did not take any care at all to avoid harming the victim. If you're found guilty of defamation, the court will decide how much money you must pay to the victim. The victim may ask for damages. The amount of damages depends on how much the defamer harmed the victim."

    "question": "Options strategy - When stocks go opposite of your purchase?",
    "response": "2019, you might have purchased stock in the company. As such, you might have sold some of your shares at a profit. If you have some of the original stock remaining, you can sell it now and use the money to buy more shares. For example, you might have bought 100 shares of stock in company A at $50 per share, for a total of $5,000. Now, you might have 50 shares of stock in the company, which is worth $75 per share. You could sell the 50 shares you have left for $3,750. You could then use that money to buy more shares of the company. This would allow you to increase your stake in the company. The price of the stock is likely to fluctuate over time. As such, you may want to consider selling some of your shares if you think the price will drop further. For example, if the price of the stock falls to $40 per share, you might sell 10 of the shares you have left. This would give you 40 shares of stock, which is worth $1,600. You could then use that money to buy more shares of the company. This would allow you to increase your stake in the company. However, you should be careful not to sell too much of the stock too quickly. If you sell too much of the stock too quickly, you may miss out on potential gains. For example, if the price of the stock rises to $80 per share, you may miss out on the potential gain of $2,000. You could also sell some of the stock if you think the price will rise further.

There's also no evidence that you can grow new neurons. Some scientists think that having more neurons might be good for learning and memory, but they haven't been able to prove this. The human brain doesn't change much after puberty. It may shrink a little bit as you get older, but most of its structure is set before age 25. So if you're over 25 and want to get smarter, you'll need to work at it! The brain gets its nutrition from blood, which carries nutrients to all parts of the body. If you eat well and exercise, your brain will get what it needs to stay healthy. You can keep your brain healthy by playing games, reading, doing puzzles, and taking care of yourself. The brain can't \"grow\" new neurons or make itself bigger. The brain can't grow new neurons or make itself bigger. Instead, it changes in other ways. For example, the brain creates new connections between existing neurons, called synapses. These new connections help you learn new things and remember information. This process is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. When you learn something new, the brain forms new connections between existing neurons. These new connections help you learn new things and remember information. The more you practice something, the stronger the connection between those neurons becomes. For example, when you learn to play an instrument, you strengthen the connections between neurons in your brain. This helps you remember music notes and play the instrument better. The more you practice, the stronger the connections become. The same thing happens when you learn to speak a new language. As you learn the new words, you strengthen the connections between neurons in your brain. This helps you remember new words and use them correctly. The more you practice speaking the new language, the stronger the connections become. When you don't use your brain, the connections between neurons weaken. This is why it's important to do activities that challenge your brain. If you stop using your brain, you'll lose some of the connections between neurons. You can help build new connections by doing new activities. For example, learning a new"

    "question": "Why is it bad for young kids to weightlift​ ? Why do medical professionals advise against intense strength training for little kids ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "medical experts who have studied the issue and agree that too much too fast can be harmful. The child may not be ready to handle the stress of lifting heavy weights. They can cause an increase in hormones called growth hormone and cortisol. This can lead to excessive bone growth and can also damage the joints. This can also cause an increase in bone density and this can lead to osteoporosis later in life. These effects are more pronounced when the child lifts weights before puberty, which occurs at age 10 to 12 for girls and age 12 to 14 for boys. However, some experts believe that the risk of injury is greatest in children ages 9 to 13. This is because the bones are still developing but the muscles are already strong enough to pull them out of place. This is why it's important to start weightlifting with light weights and to gradually increase the amount of weight as the child gets stronger. This will allow the bones to grow along with the muscles and will help prevent injury. This is also why it's important to start weightlifting under the supervision of a trained professional. This will help ensure that the child starts off correctly and will help prevent injury. This is also why it's important to start weightlifting under the supervision of a trained professional.

    "response": "Most studies find that the average mutual fund has a positive alpha over the long run. However, there are some studies that show that the average mutual fund does not beat the market over the long run. The average mutual fund may beat the market in the short run, but it is hard to say whether they will beat the market in the long run. There are many factors that affect the performance of a mutual fund such as the manager's skill, the fund's expense ratio, and the market conditions. Also, the performance of a mutual fund can be affected by the way the fund is constructed and managed. For example, if a mutual fund invests in companies with a lot of debt, then the fund's performance may be negatively impacted during times when interest rates rise. However, it is difficult to say whether the average mutual fund will beat the market in the long run because there are so many variables that can affect its performance."

    "response": "A. Wry neck (also known as torticollis) is a condition in which the head tilts to one side and the chin is pulled toward the chest. It can occur suddenly or over time. The most common causes of wry neck include: - Injuries, such as a blow to the head or whiplash from a car accident - Stiff muscles caused by arthritis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease - Infections, such as meningitis or mumps - Certain medicines - Conditions that cause muscle spasms, such as tetanus or tetanus-like conditions - Pregnancy - Other medical conditions that affect the nervous system, such as brain tumors or spinal cord problems - Tumors in the neck area - Problems with the thyroid gland Symptoms of wry neck may include: - A sudden, sharp pain in the neck - Headache - Difficulty moving the neck - Head tilt - Numbness in the arms or legs - Weakness in the shoulders or arms If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider. Treatment for wry neck depends on its cause. If the wry neck is caused by an injury, it will likely improve on its own within days or weeks. If the wry neck is caused by an infection, treatment usually involves antibiotics. If the wry neck is caused by a tumor, surgery or radiation therapy may be needed. If the wry neck is caused by a neurological disorder, such as a stroke or brain tumor, treatment will depend on the underlying cause. If the wry neck is caused by a condition that affects the thyroid gland, treatment may involve medications or surgery. If the wry neck is caused by an autoimmune disorder, treatment may involve medications. If the wry neck is caused by muscle spasms, treatments may include medications or physical therapy.

    "question": "Why does scratching my back relieve an itch but having someone else scratch it make it damn near orgasmic ? It 's just one of the best experiences of human contact , to me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Scratching your back relieves an itch because scratching stimulates nerve endings in the skin that can send messages to the brain and spinal cord that help reduce itching. The brain then sends signals to other parts of the body that can cause muscles to twitch or tremble, which can make the sensation feel good. However, you don't get as much benefit from scratching if you do it too much. Scratching too much can cause redness, swelling, and sores on the skin. Having someone else scratch your back may be more pleasurable than scratching yourself because it involves a different type of stimulation. For example, if someone else scratches your back, he or she may not be able to reach all the spots that itch. This may make the feeling of relief less intense. Also, when you scratch your own back, you can control how much you scratch. However, when someone else is doing the scratching, you have less control over how much. Having someone else scratch your back may also be more pleasurable because it's a form of physical intimacy. Physical intimacy can be soothing, especially for people who are anxious or lonely. If you have a friend or family member who would like to help relieve your itch, talk with him or her about the best way to do it. If you have chronic itching, see your doctor to find out what's causing it. Your doctor may recommend treatment options, such as medication or topical treatments."

    "response": "Smell is one of the senses that we use every day. We use it to enjoy the aroma of food and to detect danger when we smell smoke or gas leaking from a stove or an appliance. It is also important for us to be able to smell in order to identify people and animals around us. The ability to smell is controlled by special cells called olfactory neurons. These cells are located in the nose and help to detect odors in the air. When we breathe in, the odor molecules travel through the nasal passages and reach the olfactory neurons. The neurons then send signals to the brain, which interprets them as odors. The brain then decides what odor it is detecting and sends messages back to other parts of the body. This is how we know if there is smoke or gas in the house or if a friend has entered our room. Olfactory neurons are very sensitive to certain chemicals found in foods and in the environment. For example, they can detect the smell of food even before we see it. Some people have more sensitive olfactory neurons than others, which may explain why some people can smell certain things better than others. If you are concerned about your sense of smell, talk with your doctor. is not a disease. it is a normal variation in the way the human body functions. is not a disease. it is a normal variation in the way the human body functions. is not a disease. it is a normal variation in the way the human body functions. is not a disease. it is a normal variation in the way the human body functions."

If you touch the prong and get an electric shock, the ground plug will carry the electricity away from your body and keep you safe. Ground plugs are important because they help prevent accidents. The ground plug keeps you safe when something goes wrong with the electrical system. It also helps prevent fires. If there is a problem with the electrical system, the ground plug can help keep you safe and prevent a fire. Ground plugs are required by law in many countries.

    "response": "A placebo is a pill or treatment that has no effect on the body, such as a sugar pill. It is sometimes used in medicine as a comparison to other treatments. If you take a pill for your pain and feel better, your doctor may ask if you took a pill that was not supposed to help you. This helps him or her know whether the pill actually helped your pain or whether you were feeling better because you believed you were taking a pill that would help you. This type of pill is called a placebo. Many people do not understand that placebos are used in medicine. They think they will only use a pill that is known to work. Placebos can be used to help doctors decide which treatments are really working. Doctors can also use placebos to teach patients about how the mind works with the body. This helps them understand that their beliefs can affect how they feel and heal from illness. Placebos should never be used to treat serious illnesses. The pills used in placebos do not work to treat these illnesses. Some people believe that placebos can make them feel better. However, this belief is not scientific. It is not possible to prove that placebos work. People who take placebos often feel better because they are more likely to follow the doctor's instructions and take the treatment exactly as prescribed. This makes it more likely that the treatment will work. Some studies have shown that people who take placebos may feel better than people who take real medicines. This is called the \"placebo effect.\" In some cases, the placebo effect may be stronger than the effects of the medicine itself. This is why doctors sometimes give placebos to patients. If a patient feels better after taking a placebo, he or she may think that the treatment was effective. This can make the patient more likely to take the treatment again in the future."

    "response": "Prescription Medications Not Filled or Delivered on Time Many times, patients have to wait weeks, months, or even years for their medications to be filled or delivered. Some patients may be unable to afford their medications, which causes them to miss doses. Others may simply not want to wait for their medications, especially if they have an urgent medical condition. This is especially true when it comes to emergency medications that can save lives. In fact, in the United States alone, more than 1 million people die each year from preventable conditions. The prescription medications you need should be available as soon as possible. However, there are many reasons why your medication might not be filled or delivered on time. These include: Your pharmacy may not have enough of the medication you need.

    "question": "Why do scalp and muscle massages feel so much better when someone else gives them to you ? Why does nt a self - administered massage feel the same ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Self-Administered Massage vs. Professional Massage Professionals massage therapists are trained in how to perform massage therapy on clients. They learn to recognize the various muscles and tissues of the body, and they know which areas need more attention than others. They also learn how to use different techniques and pressure levels to help their clients relax and relieve stress. Self-administered massage can be just as effective as professional massage, but it may not be as beneficial for people who have never received massage therapy before. It is important to understand that self-administered massage should not be used as a substitute for professional massage therapy. If you have any concerns about your health or well-being, talk to your doctor or a massage therapist.

    "question": "How programming works ? For example how does this \" code \" make \" this \" do \" that \" ? I want to do a CompSci course at uni ! So please ELI5 ! Thanks in advance . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The computer runs the program. It is the program that tells the computer what to do. This is called executing the program. There are two main ways to write programs: 1) Writing them in assembly language 2) Writing them in high-level languages Assembly language is very low level. It is written in binary numbers and symbols. Binary numbers are made up of 0s and 1s. Symbols stand for operations and instructions. High-level languages are easier to use than assembly language. They are written in English-like words. The computer translates these words into assembly language before it runs the program. This translation is done by a program called an interpreter or compiler. The interpreter reads each line of the program and converts it into assembly language as it goes along. The compiler reads the whole program at once and converts it all into assembly language before it runs the program. The computer then runs the program using the assembly language. The computer can run many programs at the same time. It uses a special part of its memory to keep track of which program is running. This part is called the processor. The processor keeps track of which program is next to run. It also keeps track of the program's instructions. When a program is finished running, the computer moves on to the next program. This is called multitasking. The computer has lots of other parts that work with the processor. These parts are called hardware. Hardware includes the keyboard, mouse, printer, monitor, etc. These parts send information to the processor and receive information from the processor. The processor sends information to these parts. It also sends information to the hard drive. The hard drive stores the programs. The processor sends information to the hard drive so that it can read and write to the programs stored there. The processor also sends information to the floppy disk drive. The floppy disk drive stores temporary files while the computer is running. The processor also sends information to the CD-ROM drive. The CD-ROM drive stores programs that you buy from the store. The processor sends information to the CD-ROM drive so that it can read the programs stored there."

    "question": "Why are Beatles songs broken up when you listen through one headphone ? I can only hear the vocals on one side ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The Beatles are broken up when you listen through one headphone because they are recorded in mono and the headphones are stereo. The mono recording is then split into two channels (left and right) by the headphone's circuitry. This means that one channel has more bass than the other. As a result, the bass-heavy channel sounds louder and dominates the soundstage, while the other channel sounds much quieter. The Beatles are a great example of how music should be recorded in stereo. They were recorded in mono in 1964 but have been remastered and released in stereo. The stereo version has a much better balance of the left and right channels and sounds much more natural."

The site of the city has not yet been fully explored, but the remains of houses, cisterns, a well, and a small temple to Athena have been found. The city is situated on a hilltop, with views over the surrounding plain. The ruins of the city's fortifications have been uncovered, including a gatehouse, towers, and walls. The city was surrounded by a moat, which was filled with water from the nearby river. The site has also yielded many artifacts, including pottery, coins, and other items. The city's inhabitants lived in houses built of stone and brick, with roofs made of tiles or thatch. The houses were typically two-story buildings, with rooms arranged around a central courtyard. The city's economy was based on agriculture, and it exported grain and olive oil to other parts of Greece. The city was also known for its pottery, which was exported throughout the Mediterranean region. The city's population grew steadily over the centuries, reaching a peak in the second century b.c. The city was destroyed by fire in the first century b.c., and never recovered. It was abandoned in the fourth century a.d. The site of the city is now a popular tourist destination, and visitors can see the remains of the city's fortifications and other structures.

    "question": "Why does a number in a banks database signify I have money ? Like when banks transfer money , they are just changing a number in two database entries . Right ? How does that signify wealth ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The bank has your name and address and other personal information so they can send you statements and notices about your account. The bank also knows how much money is in your account because they keep track of every transaction. Every time you make a purchase or withdraw cash from an ATM, the bank records this information in your account. This information is called a \"transaction.\" Each time you make a transaction, the bank changes the amount of money in your account by adding or subtracting the transaction's value. For example, if you spend $20 on groceries, the bank will subtract $20 from your account. If you put $20 in your account at the ATM, the bank will add $20 to your account. The bank uses numbers to record transactions. For example, if you make a $20 purchase at a store, the bank might record it as a -20 (negative twenty) dollar transaction. When you put $20 into your account, the bank will record it as a +20 (positive twenty) dollar transaction. So, if you have -$10 in your account, it means you have ten dollars less than what you need to cover all your transactions. If you have $10 in your account, it means you have enough money to cover all your transactions. If you have $5 in your account, it means you don't have enough money to cover all your transactions. The bank uses numbers to keep track of your money. The numbers tell the bank how much money you have in your account. So, the number in the bank's computer tells you how much money you have in your account. The number in the bank's computer is a sign of whether you have money in your account or not."

    "question": "Trickle down economics Can someone explain the theory behind trickle down economics ? what are the benefits and drawbacks of trickle down economics ? And does it actually work ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "It is important to understand that the term \"trickle-down\" refers only to the flow of wealth from the rich to the poor. The idea is not that the rich should give away their money, but rather that they should invest it in productive enterprises that will create jobs for poor people. If you think about it, this makes sense. If rich people want to keep their money and don't spend it, then they won't be able to buy goods or services. But if rich people invest their money in productive enterprises, then they will be able to earn more money. And if they earn more money, they can spend more money on goods and services, which will help everyone else. In short, the more money the rich have, the more money they can spend. This is why many economists believe that the best way to get rich people to spend their money is to make them rich. This is the essence of trickle-down economics."

    "question": "When I need to pee , and I 'm standing there waiting , but nothing is coming out , what 's happening in my body that 's making me wait ? Shy pissers unite ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that holds urine. It's located in your pelvis. The bladder sits between the rectum and the uterus or penis. Your urethra is a tube that carries urine from your bladder to your outside body. Your urethra is the same structure as your urethra for men and women. However, men have an extra part called the prostate gland. This gland is right under the bladder. The prostate gland makes fluid that mixes with the sperm from your testicles to make semen. Semen helps move sperm through the female vagina during sexual intercourse. Semen also provides food for the sperm. The urethra passes through the prostate gland. This is why men can't get an infection in their prostate gland. Men who have had their bladder removed because of cancer may have a new way to empty their bladder. This procedure is called a suprapubic catheter. A catheter is a thin tube. The doctor puts it into the urethra. Then the doctor puts the other end of the tube into a special bag. The catheter lets urine flow into the bag instead of out of the body. Women can't get an infection in their bladder because the urethra is shorter than in men. If you have an infection in your bladder, your body will try to fight it off. The infection causes your bladder to fill up faster than usual. This makes you feel like you need to urinate more often. Your bladder muscles tighten when you're trying to urinate. These muscles help push urine out of your body. However, if your bladder is infected, these muscles don't work well. So you might not be able to urinate at all. You might not be able to feel your bladder full. This means you won't know when you need to urinate. Also, bacteria can get inside your body and cause an infection. If you have an infection in your bladder, your body will try to fight it off.

    "question": "How do carrier pigeons and the like know where to go ? I 've been watching a lot of Game of Thrones lately and its just been something on my mind . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "How Do Birds Find Their Way Home ? The ability to navigate is a complex process involving many parts of the brain. The first part of the process involves the visual system. Birds use the sun as a compass to help them find their way home. In addition, birds can also use the Earth's magnetic field as a guide. The ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field is called magnetoreception. Scientists have discovered that some birds may be able to detect the Earth's magnetic field using a special light-sensitive protein called cryptochrome. Cryptochrome has been found in the eyes of some birds, but not all. Cryptochrome has also been found in the retina of some birds. It appears that this protein helps birds see polarized light, which is light that vibrates in one direction. Some scientists believe that birds may use this type of light to determine the position of the sun and other celestial objects. Some birds can even navigate when they cannot see the sun or stars. This means that they must use their sense of smell to help them find their way home. Other scientists believe that birds may use their sense of smell to detect chemical signals given off by plants and animals along their migratory route. For example, some birds use the scent of flowers to find their way home. Other birds use the scent of insects and other animals to find their way home. Insects and animals release certain chemicals to attract mates and warn predators away. These chemicals are used by birds to find their way home. The third part of the process involves the ability to navigate using landmarks. Many birds use familiar landmarks such as mountains, rivers, coastlines, and cities to find their way home. In addition, birds can use the position of the sun, the Earth's magnetic field, and other landmarks to help them find their way home. When birds arrive at their destination, they may rest before continuing on their journey. When resting, birds can use the position of the sun and other landmarks to help them orient themselves."

    "question": "Why ca n't game developers take legal action against websites that provide hacks / cheats for their games ? Might be a stupid question but I 'd just like to know the reason why this never happens . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The answer is that it would be difficult for the game companies to win such cases. The court system doesn't have the resources to handle thousands of lawsuits from different game companies. Even if they did, the companies don't have enough money to pay for all the legal fees. The courts can't order a website to shut down because the site may not have any money left in its bank account. In fact, some websites that sell game hacks or cheats have shut down because they ran out of money. Game companies do have other ways to stop websites from selling their game hacks or cheats. They can ask search engines to remove the websites from their lists of results. They also can ask Internet service providers to block access to the sites. If these steps don't work, game companies can use copyright law to stop websites from selling their game hacks or cheats. Under copyright law, people who copy and sell others' work without permission are breaking the law. Game companies have sued many websites that sell game hacks or cheats. The websites have lost most of those cases."

    "question": "What 's currently being done about climate change ? How can I help ? Also , when will the affects become deadly ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The Earth's climate is changing. Some of the changes are caused by human activities such as burning fuel and cutting down trees. Other changes happen naturally. Scientists have learned that climate changes can affect the weather in different ways. They can also affect where plants and animals live. Climate change can also cause sea levels to rise. This can make some coastal areas wetter and more likely to flood. Climate change can even affect how we grow food. Scientists and policymakers are working hard to understand how climate change will affect our world. They're trying to find solutions to problems caused by climate change. They're also trying to prevent future problems from happening. They want to do all this while still allowing people to live on Earth in good health and comfort. Prevention is the best way to stop climate change. However, scientists and policymakers are also looking for ways to deal with climate change if it continues. What can you do? There are many things you can do to help slow climate change. For example, you can try to use less energy. You can also plant trees and other plants that take in carbon dioxide from the air. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun. It makes Earth warmer than it should be. To learn more, go to \"What Can You Do?\" at www.epa.gov/ghginfo/whatcan.html. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a website with information about climate change. Go to www.noaa.gov/globalwarming for more information. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a group of countries that work together to address climate change. The UNFCCC has a website with lots of useful information.

    "question": "Why do countries import AND export the same product , like crude oil , or chicken ? This has always confounded me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Imports and exports are two ways that countries trade with each other. Imports are things that one country buys from another country. Exports are things that one country sells to another country. A country can have imports and exports of the same thing. For example, the United States imports and exports crude oil. It imports crude oil from Saudi Arabia and exports crude oil to Canada. The United States also imports and exports chicken. It imports chicken from Mexico and exports chicken to Japan. Countries often trade with each other because they have different advantages for making goods and services. For example, the United States makes more airplanes than it needs. So the U.S. exports airplanes to other countries. Other countries make more food than they need. So those countries export food to the United States."

    "question": "No Child Left Behind Why is it necessary ? What are the pros and cons of it ? Why not have kids that understand you can fail and succeed in life ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "A: No Child Left Behind (NCLB) was signed into law on January 8, 2002, by President George W. Bush. This law was created to help all children learn to read and do math at a high level. The law says that schools must show that their students are making progress toward these goals every year. This means that schools must teach students well and give them tests to make sure they know what they need to know. The goal is for all students to be able to read and do math at a high level by the year 2014. NCLB also gives states more power to set their own standards for what students should learn in school. States will decide what tests to use to measure how well students are learning. Schools that don't meet their goals will have to change their ways of teaching. They may also have to hire new teachers or fix buildings. Some people think NCLB is good because it helps students learn. Others think it is bad because it puts too much pressure on schools. The main idea of NCLB is to help all children learn to read and do math at a high level.

    "response": "you eat fish? Fish are animals that live in water. They have gills that take oxygen from the water and breathe with them. They have fins that help them swim and a backbone that helps them stand up straight. Many people think fish are not animals because they do not have a heart. Some fish do not have hearts at all! The fish you eat are called food fish. Food fish are animals that are raised for their meat. Food fish are usually grown in tanks or ponds. People raise food fish in many parts of the world. People can eat many kinds of food fish. Some of these fish include salmon, catfish, bass, trout, cod, and herring. People also raise fish for pets. Some of these fish include goldfish, guppies, betta fish, and clownfish. You might be wondering if it is okay to eat fish. Is it okay to eat other animals? The answer to this question is different for each person. Some people think that it is not okay to eat animals. Other people think it is okay to eat animals. If you decide to eat fish, you should make sure that the fish is raised in a way that does not hurt the environment. You should also make sure that the fish has been raised in a way that is safe for humans to eat. If you decide to eat fish, you should ask your parents or guardians where the fish comes from and how it was raised. If you decide to eat fish, you should also learn about the health benefits of eating fish."

    "question": "Condensation How does it work ? Is it some process of osmosis or something ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Condensation is the process in which water vapor condenses into liquid water. It occurs when water vapor comes into contact with a surface below its temperature of saturation (the temperature at which the air is saturated with water vapor). The process is reversed during evaporation, where liquid water becomes water vapor. This process can be observed in the formation of fog and dew. In the atmosphere, condensation is one of the processes that leads to cloud formation. In contrast to evaporation, condensation is not an endothermic process, but rather exothermic. This means that condensation releases heat energy. This heat energy can contribute to warming of the air mass in which it occurs. In some cases, this heat release can be enough to cause a rise in temperature above the dew point temperature. The process is reversible. The reverse process is called sublimation. This is the process in which solid ice directly turns into water vapor without first melting. This process is the same as condensation, but with a different phase. In fact, all three processes (condensation, evaporation, and sublimation) are just different forms of the same physical process. In all three processes, heat energy is either released or absorbed. 2. A liquid is placed on a plate. The plate is then cooled until it reaches the temperature of saturation. The liquid begins to condense on the plate. As more and more liquid condenses, the temperature of the plate decreases. 3. When the temperature of the plate is equal to the temperature of saturation, no more liquid will condense. The plate is now saturated. 4. As the temperature of the plate continues to decrease, the temperature will eventually reach the dew point temperature. The temperature at which the air is saturated with water vapor is called the dew point temperature. 5. At this point, the rate of evaporation will begin to exceed the rate of condensation. As the rate of evaporation exceeds the rate of condensation, the amount of water on the plate will begin to decrease. The plate will become dry. The temperature of the plate will increase because the excess heat from the evaporation has been removed."

    "question": "What are the physics behind a helicopter flying ? Everytime I look at a helicopter it just does n't make sense to me that it would stay in the air . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The key to understanding how a helicopter works is the fact that its rotors spin up and down and backwards and forwards. When the rotor spins up, it creates a force called lift which is what keeps the helicopter in the air. The rotor also spins down to create thrust which is what moves the helicopter forward. The rotor spins back and forth to change the direction of the helicopter. This is called pitch. A helicopter has two rotors one on each side of the fuselage (the main body). The left rotor is called the main rotor and the right rotor is called the tail rotor. The main rotor creates lift and the tail rotor creates thrust. The main rotor is connected to the engine and rotates around a vertical axis. The tail rotor is connected to the tail boom which is attached to the main rotor hub and rotates around a horizontal axis. The tail rotor helps to counteract the torque from the main rotor which causes the helicopter to turn. The tail rotor also creates thrust and moves the helicopter forward. The tail rotor is also used to control the pitch of the helicopter. The tail rotor can be tilted forward or backward to control the pitch. If the tail rotor is tilted forward the helicopter will pitch forward if the tail rotor is tilted backward the helicopter will pitch backward. The tail rotor can also be tilted to the left or right to control the yaw of the helicopter. If the tail rotor is tilted to the left the helicopter will yaw to the left if the tail rotor is tilted to the right the helicopter will yaw to the right. The tail rotor can also be tilted to the front or back to control the roll of the helicopter. If the tail rotor is tilted to the front the helicopter will roll to the front if the tail rotor is tilted to the back the helicopter will roll to the back. The tail rotor can also be tilted to the left or right to control the pitch of the helicopter. If the tail rotor is tilted to the left the helicopter will pitch forward if the tail rotor is tilted to the right the helicopter will pitch backward.

    "question": "Why do people instinctively dislike insects ? What makes them so creepy or disgusting ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Insects Insects are tiny creatures that can be found almost anywhere. Insects have six legs and usually two pairs of wings. Insects come in many shapes and sizes and are found all over the world. Insects can be helpful or harmful to humans. Some insects eat plants, while others eat other insects. Some insects help with pollination, which is the transfer of pollen from one flower to another. Others can damage crops or spread diseases. Some insects are even poisonous or dangerous. For example, some species of ants and bees can sting and cause pain and swelling. Other species of ants and bees can also attack in large groups and bite. Insects can also carry parasites and viruses that can make humans sick. Many insects are also food for other animals, such as birds and bats. Insects can also be pests that can damage homes and other buildings. For example, termites can damage wooden structures. Insects are important for the survival of many animal and plant species. Some insects can even help clean up dead organisms. However, not all insects are beneficial. Insects that can be harmful to humans include mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, bed bugs, cockroaches, flies, and aphids. Many people are allergic to certain types of insects. People who are allergic to insects can have reactions ranging from mild to severe. Severe reactions can be life-threatening. The most common insect-related health problems include allergic reactions, stings, bites, and parasitic infestations. Stings and bites can cause pain, swelling, itching, and redness at the site of the bite or sting. Bites and stings can also cause other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and hives. Severe allergic reactions can cause more serious symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shock. People who are allergic to insects may also experience symptoms when they come into contact with the insect or its waste. For example, people who are allergic to dust mites may have asthma attacks when they come into contact with dust mite droppings. People who are allergic to cockroaches may have allergic reactions when they come into contact with cockroach feces, saliva, or urine. Insect bites and stings can also cause allergic reactions. For example, people who are allergic to bee stings may experience anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can lead to death if not treated quickly. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. An"

The cable can be seen as a dark line in the water. : This is an image of a submarine cable in the ocean. It shows how the cable is laid down on the ocean floor. The cable can be seen as a dark line in the water. Submarine cables run from one land area to another. They carry signals that travel through the water and air to reach their destination. These signals can include telephone calls, video streams, or internet data. When a submarine cable reaches its destination, it connects to a landline network. This allows people in different parts of the world to communicate with each other. You can see some of these cables running across the Atlantic Ocean in this satellite image. Many of the cables are also visible underwater along the coastlines of Europe and Africa. Some of the cables even cross the Great Lakes in North America. The cables run under the surface of the water. They are protected from damage by ships and fishing boats. The cables also have protective jackets to keep them from being damaged by salt water. The cables can withstand pressure from the weight of the water above them. The cables can also withstand extreme temperatures. The cables can be up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) long. They may run for hundreds of kilometers before reaching their destination. In some cases, the cables run for thousands of kilometers. The cables are buried in the sand at the bottom of the ocean. This helps protect them from damage by storms and rough seas. The cables are also protected from animals that try to eat them. For example, the cables are not eaten by sea cucumbers. Sea cucumbers can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) long. The cables are also protected by a special coating that repels fish and other sea creatures. The cables can also be hidden under sand and rocks.

    "question": "Why are the video files movie theaters use so much larger ( 100 + GB ) than the files that are put on blu - ray discs which are excellent quality ? Even though the files movie theaters use are 4k , why the huge difference ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The difference is that Blu-ray Discs are a consumer format and are not capable of storing the amount of data needed for a feature film in 4K resolution. The video and audio data is compressed to reduce the file size. In order to store this compressed data, Blu-ray uses a smaller number of tracks per side, which means each track can hold less data. The data stored on each track is then grouped into sectors and interleaved across all the tracks to ensure that no single track will be overloaded. This means that each sector contains only a small portion of the total amount of data. To make up for the fact that each track holds less data, Blu-ray uses more tracks per side, resulting in a higher overall capacity. Blu-ray uses a 25 Gbit/s data rate for recording data onto the disc, which is twice as fast as DVD. This allows for faster transfer rates from the disc to the computer, but it also results in a smaller amount of data being stored on the disc. Blu-ray also has a larger bit error rate than DVDs, meaning that it is more susceptible to damage during read/write operations. This is because the larger bit error rate means that there is a higher chance of errors occurring when the data is being written or read from the disc. The larger bit error rate also means that there is a higher chance of errors occurring when the data is being written or read from the disc. This is because the larger bit error rate means that there is a higher chance of errors occurring when the data is being written or read from the disc. Blu-ray uses a different type of laser to read the data from the disc. This laser is more sensitive than the one used on DVDs, which means that it can detect even the smallest changes in the disc's surface. This makes Blu-ray more resistant to scratches and other forms of damage.

    "question": "How can severe mania be treated?Yes, my sister is in an acute manic state: pressured speech, grandiosity, paranoia, inappropriate humor, out of touch with reality, etc. She just started on Divalproex, 250 mg. How long will it take to take effect. ??How fast can it be titrated up? What s the therapeutic dose for a 69 year old woman of 5 ft , 116 lbs?",
    "response": "Severe mania is treated with antipsychotic medications such as lithium, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Lithium is usually the first choice for treating mania. It can also be used to treat depression that occurs after mania has gone away. If you have kidney or liver disease, your doctor may prescribe another medication. The amount of lithium needed to control symptoms depends on how severe they are and how you respond to the medication. Your doctor will adjust the dosage until the correct amount is found. He or she will monitor your lithium level through blood tests. The goal is to find the lowest dose that controls your symptoms. Your doctor will continue to check your lithium level every few weeks at first. As you become better, he or she will check your level less often. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you should talk with your doctor about taking lithium. He or she can tell you whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks to you and your baby. If you have not responded to lithium, your doctor may try another antipsychotic medicine. The most commonly prescribed medicines are olanzapine (ZYPREXA) and quetiapine (Seroquel). These medicines can relieve mood swings and hallucinations. They are not as effective for treating depression. If you don't get better after trying two different antipsychotic medicines, your doctor may try other medications. Sometimes a combination of antipsychotic medicines is used. Medications that treat bipolar disorder may cause side effects. Some people have trouble sleeping when they start taking these medicines. Others have dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and weight gain. If you experience side effects, call your doctor right away. He or she may suggest ways to reduce them or prescribe medicine to treat them."

    "response": "Windshield wiper blades are designed to be installed on the outside of the windshield. They are not designed to be installed on the inside of the windshield. The inside of the windshield is coated with a layer of plastic called Teflon. This coating makes it difficult for the blade to stick to the windshield when it is installed. If you install a blade backwards (on the inside) it will not stick to the windshield and may cause it to fall off or become damaged. It's best to install the blades correctly the first time. If you do need to replace just one blade, you can remove it using the special tool provided in the package. Just make sure to take the other blade off before you go to replace it."

The torrent file itself can be distributed to other computers using a web site or email. When you download a torrent file, you're not actually downloading the entire file at once. Instead, you're downloading the pieces that make up the file. The pieces are stored on your computer until they're needed. Once the entire file has been downloaded, it can be opened and used just like any other file. You can use a torrent client to help you download and manage the pieces.

    "response": "NASA's space probes use two main types of instruments to find their way in space: - Radio telescopes that can receive signals from Earth and other spacecraft - Cameras that take pictures of stars and planets as they pass by The radio telescopes allow the probe to communicate with Earth, and the cameras allow the probe to see where it is going. The radio telescope sends information back to Earth about the probe's position and speed. It also receives information from Earth about what the probe should do next. This information allows the probe to make changes to its speed and direction so that it will arrive at its target planet at the right time. The cameras take pictures of stars and planets as they pass by. The probe uses these pictures to find its way through space. It looks for bright stars and planets to help it stay on course. For example, when a probe reaches Jupiter, it can use the gas giant's bright light to guide it toward the moon Io. It can then use pictures of Io to find the moon's orbit around Jupiter. When the probe arrives at Io, it can use the moon's light to guide it to its target on Io. The probe can even look for moons and rings of other planets. This helps the probe understand the planet's environment and find its way around it. The probe can even look for moons and rings of other planets.

    "question": "How to have a safe pregnancy?hello doctor, ia m 32 years old lady, i have 1 girl whose age is 9 years old. this year i gt pregnancy again which gt aborterd by medicines then my tsh gt 8 point high now i am normal i want to conceive again but not getting pregnancy, wat should i do for prewgnancy, plz help",
    "response": "The most important thing you can do to make sure your baby stays healthy is to avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, and taking drugs or illegal substances while you're pregnant. It's also important that you don't take any medications unless your doctor prescribes them. Smoking, drinking, taking drugs, and using illegal substances during pregnancy can harm your baby in many ways. These include low birth weight, premature birth, and even stillbirth. If you smoke, drink, take drugs, or use illegal substances, stop before you get pregnant. Even if you've been smoking or drinking alcohol, you can reduce the risk of harm to your baby by quitting. Alcohol, drugs, and illegal substances can cause birth defects and other problems. Talk with your doctor about what you need to do to quit. If you've already gotten pregnant and you've smoked or drank alcohol, talk with your doctor right away. He or she can give you advice on how to improve your chances of having a healthy baby. Some women who get pregnant after trying several times may have trouble becoming pregnant. This can be very stressful and upsetting. If you're having trouble getting pregnant, talk with your doctor. He or she can help find out why you're not able to become pregnant. Sometimes it takes longer than expected to become pregnant. But you shouldn't try harder than you already are. Try to relax and enjoy the early stages of pregnancy. If you're not getting pregnant after a few months, talk with your doctor. He or she can check for health problems that might affect your ability to become pregnant. Your doctor also can suggest tests that can help you learn whether there's anything wrong with your eggs, sperm, uterus, or fallopian tubes. If you're not getting pregnant after trying for more than a year, you might want to consider seeing a fertility specialist. A fertility specialist is a doctor who has special training in treating infertility."

    "question": "Please explain what is \"Kalman filter\"",
    "response": "K. 2, the Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm for estimating the state of a system from a series of noisy measurements. The Kalman filter has been applied to many problems, including radar and sonar tracking, navigation, and communication. It is also used in computer vision, robotics, and control systems. A good introduction to the Kalman filter is given by Wikipedia. The Kalman filter is based on the following assumptions: 1. The system can be described by a set of linear differential equations with constant coefficients. 2. The initial state of the system is known with certainty. 3. The measurements are made with noise that is independent and identically distributed. 4. The measurement process is linear and time-invariant. The Kalman filter uses these assumptions to estimate the state of the system at each time step. The filter is called a \"recursive\" filter because it updates its estimates based on new measurements as they become available. The Kalman filter consists of two main parts: the prediction step and the update step. In the prediction step, the filter estimates the state of the system at the next time step based on the previous state and the system's dynamics. In the update step, the filter incorporates the new measurement into its estimate of the state. The Kalman filter uses the following formulae to perform the prediction and update steps: Prediction Step: Let x_k be the state estimate at time k, let P_k be the covariance matrix (a measure of the uncertainty of the state estimate), let F_k be the state transition matrix (a matrix that describes how the state evolves over time), and let w_k be the process noise. Then, the state estimate at time k+1 can be estimated using the following formula: x_k+1 = F_k * x_k + w_k Update Step: Let y_k be the measurement at time k, let H_k be the measurement matrix (a matrix that describes how the measurement relates to the state), let R_k be the measurement noise, and let v_k be the observation noise. Then, the state estimate at time k+1 can be updated using the following formula: x_k+1 = x_k + K_k * (y_k - H_k * x_k) P_k+1 = (1 - K_k * H_k) * P_k where K_k is the Kalman gain, which is a scalar that determines how much weight to give to the measurement relative to the prediction. The Kalman gain is calculated using the following formula:"

    "response": "The Los Angeles Clippers are owned by Donald Sterling. He's the one who owns the team. Donald Sterling sold the Clippers to Steve Ballmer in 2014 for $ 2 billion.

Donald Sterling has been known to say some not-so-nice things about black people. He was caught on tape saying racist things about African Americans. Donald Sterling lost his job at the Staples Center. The Staples Center is where the Clippers play basketball. He also lost his job at the National Basketball Association (NBA). The NBA is an organization that runs basketball leagues all over the United States. He lost his job because of the racist things he said. After Donald Sterling was fired from the NBA, the NBA fined him $ 2. 5 million. Donald Sterling also paid $ 1. 5 million to settle with the families of two black men who were shot by police officers. Donald Sterling had to pay the money because he made fun of them on social media. Donald Sterling also gave up his voting rights in the Clippers. His children will be able to vote on what happens to the team. Donald Sterling can still sell the team if he wants to. Donald Sterling could have sold the team for more than $ 2 billion before he lost his job at the NBA. Donald Sterling has already sold the team for $ 2 billion. So he didn't make the Forbes \" The world 's 50 most valuable sports teams \" list. Donald Sterling's children might want to sell the team again. If they do, they could make even more money than $ 2 billion."

    "response": "Logic 101 - Logic 101 is the study of truth and falsehood. In other words, it's about understanding how to make logical arguments and draw valid conclusions from premises. It's also about recognizing fallacies and being able to spot them when they're used in an argument. The key to understanding logic is to be able to identify the different types of logical statements and understand how they work together to form a coherent argument. If you can do this, then you'll be able to follow most arguments and make your own logical arguments. However, there are some things that even the best logicians can't do. One of these is called a paradox. A paradox is a statement or argument that seems to contradict itself. For example, if someone says \"All swans are white\" and then later says \"There are black swans,\" this creates a paradox because both statements cannot be true at the same time. Another type of logical statement is called a contradiction. A contradiction is a statement that directly contradicts another statement. For example, if someone says \"The sky is blue\" and then later says \"The sky is not blue,\" this creates a contradiction because the two statements cannot both be true at the same time. There are also other types of logical statements such as conditional statements, disjunctive statements, and conjunctive statements. Conditional statements are statements that have a condition attached to them. Disjunctive statements are statements that have two or more options attached to them. Conjunctive statements are statements that have multiple statements connected by \"and\" or \"or.\" Understanding these different types of logical statements is important because they help us understand how arguments work and why certain arguments are valid while others are not.

In addition, some companies have their own policies about whether they will hire someone who uses marijuana even if it is for medical purposes. If you are considering applying for a job in a state where marijuana is legal, you may want to call the company or check its website to find out what its policy is. The following section explains the federal law as well as the laws of a few states that have made changes to the law. If you are considering working for a company that follows federal law, you should be aware of the potential consequences of using marijuana. If you are considering working for a company that follows state law, you should also be aware of the potential consequences of using marijuana. You should talk to your doctor before taking any medications or drugs, including marijuana. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug under federal law. This means that marijuana is considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. However, marijuana is legal for medical use in some states. Under federal law, employers can legally fire employees for using marijuana, even if it is for medical purposes. Employers can also test employees for marijuana and fire employees if they fail the test.

    "question": "Howcome anxiety and depression are so common ? Is it something to do with society and lifestyles or how children are raised ? Or is it simply because it 's more acceptable to talk about it which means it 's more easily diagnosed ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": ", anxiety and depression are common, but they are not the same thing. Anxiety is an emotion that everyone experiences from time to time. It's a feeling of worry, nervousness, fear, or uneasiness about what may happen in the future. Depression is a mood disorder. It is a serious medical condition that can have many different symptoms, including sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in things once enjoyed, fatigue, problems concentrating, sleep disturbances, and thoughts of death or suicide. Anxiety and depression are both serious health conditions that require treatment. Anxiety disorders affect about 18 percent of Americans. Depression affects about 7 percent of Americans. Anxiety disorders and major depression are two of the most common mental health disorders in the United States. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic anxiety disorder, panic panic anxiety disorder, panic phobias, social phobia, and specific phobias. Major depression is characterized by depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Other symptoms of major depression include: - loss of interest or pleasure in activities normally enjoyed - fatigue or decreased energy - difficulty sleeping - loss of appetite and weight loss or overeating and weight gain - trouble thinking, concentrating, or making decisions - feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt - thoughts of death or suicide - If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor. If you think someone you know has these symptoms, encourage him or her to see a doctor. It is important to get help if you or someone you know has these symptoms. Treatment is available. The good news is that anxiety and depression can be treated successfully. Anxiety disorders and major depression are treatable with medication, therapy, or both. Medications and therapies that work well for one person may not work as well for another. It may take several tries before finding the right combination of treatments. But treatment does work. The sooner treatment begins, the sooner people will start to feel better. If you have anxiety or depression, you're not alone. Millions of Americans have anxiety or depression. More than 10 million Americans have both anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression can be disabling, but they are also treatable.

    "question": "Why are \" Romeo and Juliet \" laws called \" Romeo and Juliet \" laws ? Was there a part in that play about statutory rape that I missed ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "? Romeo and Juliet, of course. The word comes from the play of Shakespeare's. Shakespeare's play is set in the 16th century, which was long before the invention of the birth control pill or other forms of contraception. Back then, most people had sex with their partners when they were teenagers, because it was the only way to have children. And if you wanted to marry, you had to be at least 21 years old. So many young people got married very young, and many of them were impregnated before they could legally marry. Some of these young women ended up having babies out of wedlock. Others were raped. Many of these young women were not prepared for motherhood, and many of them were not prepared for marriage. They were also not prepared for the consequences of being pregnant and unmarried. In order to prevent this kind of thing from happening, the law made it illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to get married without parental consent. This is what we call a Romeo and Juliet law. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that California's anti-rape law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The law prohibited men from having sexual intercourse with a woman who was younger than 18 unless she was his legal spouse. The Court said this law was unconstitutional because it discriminated against men. The Court said that this law treated men and women differently. It said that this law gave men the right to have sex with a minor girl but took away her right to have sex with an older man. The Court said that this was unfair. The Court said that this was discrimination based on gender. The Court said that the law should be changed so that it treats men and women equally. The Court said that the law should protect girls and boys who want to have sex but do not want to get married. The Court said that the law should protect girls and boys who want to have sex but do not want to get pregnant.

    "question": "Why are species like the mosquito still around ? What purpose do they serve ? Is there any reason that we would n't be able to just end all Mosquitos ? Would the ecosystem take a big hit due to the loss ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Mosquitoes are very important for the food chain and the ecosystem. They play an important role in the food chain because they are a main food source for birds, bats, fish, frogs, spiders, dragonflies, and other animals. Mosquitoes are also important in the ecosystem because they help pollinate plants. When a female mosquito takes a blood meal, she lays eggs. The eggs then hatch into larvae which live in water. The larvae eat algae and plant matter. The larvae eventually pupate and turn into adult mosquitoes. The cycle continues. If you were to get rid of the mosquitoes, the birds, bats, fish, frogs, spiders, dragonflies, and other animals would lose their food source. The ecosystem would have a hard time without the mosquitoes. Also, if there were no mosquitoes, there would be no way for plants to be pollinated. Without mosquitoes, the ecosystem would be out of balance. There is no reason that we wouldn't be able to just end all mosquitoes. The ecosystem would be out of balance without them."

If you're younger than 591/2, you'll also need to pay taxes on the amount you withdraw. However, if you have held your Roth IRA for more than five years, then you can take out the money without any tax penalties, and you won't owe taxes on the money you've withdrawn either. This means that you can withdraw money from your Roth IRA at any time, and it will not affect your taxes or your eligibility for future tax-free withdrawals. 4. If you withdraw money from your Roth IRA before age 591/2 or before you've held the account for five years, you'll be subject to both a 10% penalty tax and ordinary income taxes on the amount withdrawn. 5.

    "question": "Why race car tires have more traction without treads but consumer tires have more traction with treads . Uh , see title . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Consumer tires have treads and race tires do not. The tread provides grip, which is why you can drive on wet roads without hydroplaning, and it also helps to keep the vehicle in line. The tread also allows the tire to flex more, which is why you don't need as much air pressure in your car's tires as you would in a race car. The tread also helps to absorb some of the shocks and vibrations that come from driving on rough roads. In short, the tread gives you more traction on the road."

    "question": "Please explain what is \"Gradient descent\"",
    "response": "In the above image, we can see that there is a single minimum in the function f(x). We can also see that the function f(x) is a convex function. The minimum of the function f(x) is the point at which the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point is zero and the curvature of the curve at that point is positive. We can find the minimum of the function f(x) using the following steps: 1. Take the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point. 2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x. This will give us the point at which the slope of the tangent line to the curve is zero. 3. Take the second derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the curvature of the curve at any point. 4. Evaluate the second derivative at the point found in step 2. If the value of the second derivative at that point is positive, then the point is a minimum of the function f(x). If the value of the second derivative at that point is negative, then the point is a maximum of the function f(x). 5. Plot the function f(x) on a graph and mark the minimum point. f(x) = 0, where a > 0. We can see that the function f(x) has two minimum points. In order to find the minimum points, we need to take the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point.

    "response": "Your nose produces mucus to trap the germs that cause colds, flu, and other infections. The mucus also helps keep your airways moist so they can move oxygen into your bloodstream. Mucus is made in two places in your body: - The nasal cavity (the inside of your nose) - The trachea (windpipe) When you have a cold or flu, your body makes more mucus than usual. This extra mucus is trapped in your nose, making it run. The extra mucus also keeps your airways moist, which helps you breathe better. More information about mucus production and how it helps you stay healthy is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) What Is Mucus? NHLBI Publication No. 02-6190."

    "question": "Where does water go during low - tide ? There ’s a lot of water on beaches in high - tide but where does this water go once it is low - tide ? Does it concentrate elsewhere ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When the tide goes out, it leaves behind sandbars, pools and puddles. If you're lucky, you'll find some of the best swimming spots at low tide. The water may be shallow enough to walk through or swim in, and there may even be a nice sandy beach to sun yourself on. But if you're not careful, you can get into trouble. When the water goes out, it takes with it anything that was living in the water. This includes fish, crabs, clams, oysters, sea urchins, and other creatures. You might step on them or catch them with your bare feet. The water also takes with it any rocks, shells, or seaweed that were lying on the bottom. These can be dangerous if you step on them and break your skin. The water will also take away any plants that grow on the sand. So don't touch anything you see when you're at low tide. Remember that the ocean is very strong and powerful. It can move huge amounts of sand and rock around and can knock down trees and buildings. If you're at low tide and you want to collect shells or other things, be sure to stay close to the water's edge so you don't have to walk too far. Look for safe places to walk, such as sandbars or rocky areas. And always be aware of what's going on around you."

    "response": "The Earth's gravity pulls the water in the oceans toward its center. This creates a bulge of water on each side of the Earth. The Moon's gravity pulls the water toward it, which is why the bulges face the Moon. This causes the tides. The Moon's gravity is much stronger than the Earth's because the Moon is much closer to the Earth. It also has a much greater mass. A glass of water or a small pond doesn't have enough mass to cause tides."

    "question": "Companies that use their cash to buy back stock, issue dividends, etc. — how does this this typically affect share price?",
    "response": "A company can use its cash in many ways, including buying back shares of its own stock and paying dividends to shareholders. However, if the company uses its cash to buy back its own shares or pay dividends, it will reduce the number of shares outstanding. This will increase the value of each remaining share, which will cause the stock price to rise. Conversely, if the company uses its cash to expand its operations or invest in new projects, it will have more shares outstanding, which will decrease the value of each share, causing the stock price to fall. So, using cash to buy back shares or pay dividends typically increases the stock price, while using cash to expand operations or invest in new projects typically decreases the stock price."

    "question": "Choosing the limit when making a limit order?",
    "response": "If you want to buy or sell a stock at a specific price, you can use a limit order. This means you tell your broker to buy or sell a stock only if it is available at that price or lower for stocks or higher for bonds. If the stock isn't available at that price, the order will not be filled. A limit order does not guarantee that you will get the stock at the price you want. The stock may be available at a different price when the order is filled. Limit orders do not require a minimum amount of money. They allow you to trade as little as one share of stock. The stock you want to trade must be listed on an exchange. Exchange-traded funds and other exchange-traded securities also can be traded with limit orders. Limit orders do not expire unless you cancel them. You can cancel a limit order any time before it is filled. This means you can change your mind about buying or selling the stock without losing money. Limit orders are often used to avoid buying or selling at a bad time. For example, if you think a stock is going to go up in value, you can place a limit order to buy the stock at a price above its current market value. This way, you will pay less than the current market price if you decide to buy the stock later. You can also use limit orders to sell a stock at a price below the market price. This can help you avoid selling a stock at a bad time, such as when the stock is going down in value. You can use limit orders to avoid buying or selling at a bad time.

    "response": "Fire. The visible part of the fire consists of flames. These are made of hot gases and particles that burn in the air. The gases and particles come from things that have burned. They include wood, paper, plastic, and other materials. As these things burn, they break apart into gases and particles. Some of the gases and particles are heated up to very high temperatures. This makes them glow with bright light. The light from the glowing gases and particles makes the flame. As the flame burns higher and higher, it gets hotter and brighter. The heat from the flame causes more things to burn. The heat also causes the flame to burn longer and longer. As the flame burns higher and higher, it can reach up to 1000 degrees Celsius. This is very hot! The heat from the flame can cause the materials around it to catch fire. This makes the fire spread. As the fire spreads, it can get bigger and more intense. The fire can also become very dangerous. As the fire becomes more intense, it can burn more things. The fire can also burn for a longer time. This makes it even harder to put out. As the fire burns, it can get so big that it can't be stopped. It can burn down houses, cars, and even whole cities. Fire can also make the air very dirty. It can make the air smoky and hard to breathe. It can make the air poisonous. This can make it hard for people and animals to live. Fire can also hurt or kill people and animals. Fire can also be very dangerous to firefighters. Firefighters try to fight fires to protect people and property. Firefighters can be hurt or killed if they don't know how to protect themselves.

    "question": "How does neural networking work and what are the uses of such systems ? I.E. Google 's Deep Dream project Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Neural networks are computer programs that learn from data just as human brains do. They're made up of interconnected nodes or neurons, which can be arranged in layers, to perform computations on data. Neurons take their name from the way they process information in the brain. The input layer is the first layer of neurons in a network. These neurons take in data and send it along to the next layer of neurons, called the hidden layer. Hidden layers are called \"hidden\" because you don't see them in the network. Instead, they're inside the program. Hidden layers can be repeated multiple times to make deeper networks. Each time a neuron receives information from other neurons, it performs a computation on that information. Then, it passes its results to the next layer of neurons. For example, if a network is trying to recognize an image, each neuron might detect a particular feature of the image, such as a line or a curve. The network will use many neurons to recognize many features. When all of the neurons have finished processing the data, the network will have learned how to identify the object in the image. Networks can also output information, such as predictions about future events. These outputs can be used for many different purposes, including predicting prices, diagnosing diseases, and even making movies. The most popular types of neural networks are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and autoencoders. Convolutional neural networks are especially good at recognizing images. They can help us understand how the human brain works. Recurrent neural networks are especially good at processing sequential data, such as text and speech. They can be used to generate text, music, and more. Autoencoders are especially good at compressing and decompressing data. They can be used for many different purposes, including improving the performance of other neural networks."

    "question": "Price movement behaviour before earnings announcements",
    "response": "Figure 1. Figure 1.\nThe graph shows that the price of stock A increased after the earnings announcement, while the price of stock B decreased. The graph also shows that the price of stock A decreased before the earnings announcement, while the price of stock B increased. This suggests that the price movements of the two stocks were opposite to each other. This is an example of cointegration, which is a statistical property of time series variables that are linearly related. In other words, the two stocks move together in a predictable way. The relationship between the two stocks can be expressed as follows: A = k + lB, where A and B are the prices of the two stocks, k and l are constants, and t is the time. This equation is called the cointegrating equation. The cointegrating equation can be used to estimate the parameters k and l. If the cointegrating equation is estimated using all the data available, the estimated parameters will be biased. However, if the cointegrating equation is estimated using only the data before the earnings announcement, the estimated parameters will be unbiased. This is because the cointegrating equation is based on the historical relationship between the two stocks, which is not affected by the earnings announcement. The estimated parameters can then be used to forecast the future price movements of the two stocks.

    "question": "How are Canada Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) & related tax measures changing in 2015?",
    "response": "The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a new federal benefit for Canadian families with children aged under 18. It replaces the old universal child care benefit (UCCB) and other programs that provided financial support to parents for their children's education, health care, and other needs. The CCB provides monthly payments to eligible families of up to $6,000 per child. In addition, the government has introduced a new income-tested benefit called the Working Income Tax Benefit (WITB). This benefit provides up to $3,000 in additional monthly payments to eligible working parents who earn less than $47,000 annually. Together, these two benefits provide families with an average of $9,000 per child per year. The CCB is available to all Canadian families with children under 18, regardless of whether they live in a province or territory. However, it is only available to families with incomes below a certain level. Eligible families must have a gross annual income of less than $90,000 to qualify for the full amount of the CCB. Families with incomes between $90,000 and $120,000 will receive a reduced amount of the CCB based on their income. Families with incomes above $120,000 will not qualify for the CCB at all. The WITB is also income-tested. Eligible working parents with incomes below $47,000 will receive up to $3,000 in additional monthly payments. Parents with incomes between $47,000 and $60,000 will receive a reduced amount of the WITB based on their income. Parents with incomes above $60,000 will not qualify for the WITB at all. The WITB is only available to working parents who earn less than $47,000 annually. Both the CCB and the WITB are intended to help low-income families with children. They are designed to provide financial support to families with children who are struggling to make ends meet. The CCB is particularly aimed at helping families with children who do not work outside the home. These families often face significant challenges in providing for their children's needs. The WITB is aimed at helping working parents who are struggling to make ends meet. These parents often face significant challenges in supporting their families. The CCB and the WITB are both"

    "question": "What is insider trading exactly?",
    "response": "Insider trading is the buying and selling of stocks or other securities by people who have access to nonpublic information about the company. Insider trading can occur in many ways, such as by purchasing shares before a major corporate event or by receiving confidential information from employees or customers. Insiders often have an unfair advantage over other investors because they know more about the company's financial health and prospects. This unfair advantage can lead to significant profits for insiders while causing harm to other investors who do not have access to the same information. The practice of insider trading is illegal in most countries, including the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforces the laws against insider trading and investigates cases of suspected misconduct. The SEC has the authority to bring civil and criminal actions against individuals and companies that engage in insider trading. In addition, some countries have enacted laws that allow whistleblowers to report insider trading and receive rewards for their efforts. In recent years, there has been increased attention on the issue of insider trading, with new regulations and enforcement actions being taken to combat this practice. The SEC has also taken steps to increase transparency and accountability in the financial markets. For example, the SEC has implemented a system for reporting suspicious trades and has encouraged companies to disclose information about their potential conflicts of interest. These efforts have helped to reduce the incidence of insider trading and promote fair and efficient markets. The bottom line: Insider trading is illegal and harmful to the integrity of the financial markets. The SEC and other regulatory bodies work hard to prevent and punish this practice, but it remains a serious concern.

    "response": "The temperature of the blood is one of the things that affects how much the body needs to get rid of heat.

    "question": "Why do you need to have an empty stomach before having an operation ? I 've heard before this has to do with the anaesthesia not working properly but would like a more thorough answer Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When you have surgery, you need to be asleep or very relaxed so that you won't feel any pain or remember anything about the operation. The medicine used to make you go to sleep is called an anesthetic. An anesthetic can cause problems if your tummy is full of food and drinks. When your tummy is full, it may make you sick after the operation. It also makes it hard for you to breathe normally while you're sleeping. If you eat something before surgery, you might even vomit (throw up) in your sleep. Vomiting can be dangerous if you're asleep because you might choke on the vomit. So doctors tell patients to not eat anything for 8 hours before surgery. That's why you need to have an empty stomach before having an operation."

    "question": "Why can extreme stress cause a psychotic episode ? What is the brains point in doing this ( like is it protecting itself ) ? Are some people more likely for this to happen ? Or will everyone eventually have one if put through enough stress ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "is that extreme stress causes a psychotic episode. Is there a brain mechanism involved? Yes. The brain is able to protect itself from harm by responding to stress with an \"alert\" response. This alert response is meant to help the body cope with the stressor and return to a normal state. However, when the stressor continues, or the alert response does not return the body to a normal state, the brain may trigger a psychotic episode. Is there a way to prevent a psychotic episode from happening? Prevention is key. If you think you may be experiencing a psychotic episode, talk to your doctor right away. Treatment is available and can help. Will everyone eventually have a psychotic episode if they go through enough stress? No. While the brain's alert response is designed to help the body cope with stress, it does not mean that everyone will experience a psychotic episode. A person may have a psychotic episode because of extreme stress, but he or she also could have a psychotic episode because of other factors, such as a medical condition, injury, or substance abuse."

    "question": "Can dues and subscriptions expenses be deducted 100% to calculate taxable income in an LLC company?",
    "response": "The answer is no. Do I have to pay taxes on my LLC's income? LLCs are taxed based on the way they're structured. A business that is structured as an S corporation is taxed at the corporate level and then the shareholders pay individual income tax on their share of the profits. A business that is structured as an LLC is taxed at the member level and not at the corporate level. If you're an LLC owner, your profits will be subject to your personal income tax rate. This means that if you're a sole proprietor, your LLC's income will be subject to your personal income tax rate. If you're a partner, your LLC's income will be subject to your personal income tax rate and the other partners' personal income tax rates. If you're an LLC owner, you may be able to deduct any expenses related to running the LLC from your LLC's income. This can lower the amount of income subject to your personal income tax rate. This can lower the amount of income subject to your personal income tax rate. However, there are some exceptions. If your LLC has more than one member, your LLC's income must be distributed to each member based on the percentage of ownership. For example, if you're a member of an LLC with two members, and you own 60 percent of the LLC, you will receive 60 percent of the income distributed to the LLC. The other member will receive 40 percent of the income distributed to the LLC. If the LLC distributes all of its income to you, you will have to pay individual income tax on the income regardless of whether you actually receive it or not.

    "response": "It's true that asphalt can be brittle. That's one of the reasons it's not used as much in cold climates. Asphalt also tends to crack more than concrete. But asphalt is also very good at absorbing shock, which is why it's a great material for roadways. It has a low coefficient of friction (a measure of how slippery something is) and it can absorb a lot of energy without breaking. Asphalt is also less likely to shatter when hit with a heavy truck or other vehicle. Asphalt is made from petroleum and is a mixture of tiny bits of oil and gas. When you mix it with sand, gravel, and small pieces of broken up asphalt, you get a hard, durable surface that will last longer than concrete. Asphalt is also more resistant to corrosion and is easier to repair than concrete. Asphalt is also less expensive than concrete. Concrete is made from cement, which is a very strong building material. It's also more expensive than asphalt. Concrete is also more difficult to repair. If you have a pothole in your driveway, it's usually best to just patch it rather than to remove and replace the concrete. Asphalt is much easier to repair than concrete.

    "question": "How can tooth infection and swelling in the gum be treated?I currently have either an abscessed tooth or gum infection on an upper molar.  I have taken 500 mg of Penamox (which I believe is Amoxicillin) 3 times per day for two days, and 400 mg of Motrin twice per day for swelling and pain.  Can I switch to Clindamycin for two more days until I can get to a dentist?  If the antibiotic works, how long before I see signs of improvement?Thank you,Mike",
    "response": "If your infection is caused by bacteria, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Penicillin or amoxicillin is often prescribed for infections of the teeth and gums. These antibiotics are usually taken once or twice a day. Clindamycin may be prescribed if you have an allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin. If the infection is severe or does not respond to antibiotics, surgery may be needed to remove the abscess and drain the infection. The infection should begin to improve within 24 to 72 hours after starting antibiotics. If you do not improve within a week, call your doctor. If the infection does not go away, your doctor may need to change your treatment. If you have swelling or pain, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed. Do not take aspirin because it can cause bleeding. If you cannot swallow the pills, ask your doctor about liquid medications. Do not use aspirin or other NSAIDs unless your doctor tells you to. NSAIDs may mask symptoms of an infection. They can also make your condition worse. If you are allergic to penicillin or amoxicillin, talk with your doctor before taking clindamycin. Your doctor will give you instructions on how much medicine to take and when to take it. Follow the directions carefully. Take the full course of antibiotics even if you feel better. Do not stop taking the medication just because you feel better. If you stop taking the medication too soon, the infection could return. Call your doctor if you have side effects such as: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach pain Headache, dizziness, or confusion Rash, itching, or hives Muscle pain or weakness Fever or chills Severe stomach pain or bloody stools Call your doctor right away if you have any of these signs: Fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit or higher Pain that does not go away or gets worse Severe swelling around the tooth or gum area Severe headache or dizziness Severe pain that keeps you from sleeping or eating"

    "question": "Suggest treatment to increase the heightHello I have a 7 yr old girl Brook my Doc said that she is at the height she should be for her age, but I dont think so other kids in her school her age are taller. Is there something wrong with her bones? and I can i give her something to help her grow better and faster?",
    "response": "The most common cause of short stature is genetic. The condition may be inherited or due to a problem in the way the body makes hormones that affect growth. The two main hormones that control growth are growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Growth hormone is made in the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. IGF-1 is made in the liver and helps stimulate bone growth. In some cases, short stature is caused by conditions such as poor nutrition, chronic illness, or problems with the thyroid gland. Some children with short stature have no obvious cause. It's important to find out why a child is short so that treatment can begin if necessary. A health care provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating children (pediatrician) will examine your daughter and take a medical history. He or she will look for signs of a disease that could be causing her short stature. The health care provider also may recommend blood tests to check levels of growth hormone and IGF-1. If these tests show that your daughter has low levels of growth hormone or IGF-1, she may need growth hormone therapy. Growth hormone therapy is used to treat many types of short stature. Growth hormone therapy works best when started early, before age 8. This treatment usually involves injections given once or twice a week. The goal of growth hormone therapy is to stimulate growth and increase height potential. Growth hormone therapy does not work for all people with short stature. Other treatments for short stature include - surgery to correct problems with the shape of the bones in the legs and feet - treatment of conditions such as chronic illnesses or poor nutrition that can slow growth - treatment of thyroid problems that can slow growth. Your health care provider may refer you to specialists for more information about these treatments. You can learn more about growth hormone therapy in the NIDDK health topic \"Growth Hormone Therapy.\" For more information about growth hormone therapy, go to the Health Topics Growth Hormone Therapy article."

    "response": "not. The effect of caffeine on blood pressure is dose-related. The more caffeine you take, the higher your blood pressure will be. However, in most people, the peak increase in blood pressure occurs within 30 minutes after taking caffeine. After that, it slowly decreases over the next several hours. In some people, caffeine can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure. This is especially true for people who already have high blood pressure or heart disease. If you're concerned about your blood pressure, talk with your doctor before taking caffeine. Also, don't take caffeine if you're pregnant. It can raise your blood pressure and cause other problems.

    "question": "if I go half the speed of light in one direction and another body goes half the speed in the opposite direction , are n't we effectively going at the speed of light in relationship to each other ? What 's going on ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "I'll try to answer this question as simply as possible. When you travel at half the speed of light (0.5c), it's the same thing as traveling at 1/2 the speed of light in the opposite direction. So if you're traveling at 0.5c to the right, and someone else is traveling at 0.5c to the left, you'll be traveling 1c relative to them. It's not that you're traveling at the speed of light, it's just that you're moving at the same speed as them, but in opposite directions. So if you were standing still and someone was traveling at 0.5c toward you, and then you started traveling at 0.5c in the opposite direction, you'd both be traveling 0.5c, so you'd be traveling at 1c relative to each other. The speed of light is always constant, no matter what. If you're traveling at 0.5c to the right, and someone else is traveling at 0.5c to the left, they would be traveling 1c relative to you. If you're traveling at 0.5c to the right, and someone else is traveling at 0.5c to the left, they would be traveling 1c relative to you. The speed of light is always constant, no matter what.

    "question": "What investment strategy would you deduce from the latest article from Charles Munger?",
    "response": "We've all seen the recent studies that show how much money is being lost in the stock market due to short-term trading and how many dollars could be saved if investors simply waited out the ups and downs of the market. The problem with these studies is that they're based on historical performance and not on any real analysis. For example, a study that shows that a 1% loss per day over 20 days will result in a 37% loss over 20 days assumes that the investor sells at the end of each day. But that's not the case. If the investor sells at the end of each day, then he or she will have 20 losses of 1% and no gains. However, if the investor holds for 20 days, then he or she will have 19 gains of 1% and 1 loss of 1%. This means that the investor will actually make a profit of 19% instead of losing 37%. The point here is that it's important to look at what the studies really show. In this case, the studies show that short-term trading is bad and that holding for longer periods of time is better. But the studies don't tell us why. The studies don't explain why short-term trading is bad. They don't explain why holding for longer periods of time is better. The studies just show that short-term trading is bad and that holding for longer periods of time is better. So what should we do? Well, one thing we can do is to look at the historical performance of the stock market. We can look at how much money was lost in the stock market due to short-term trading and how much money could be saved if investors simply waited out the ups and downs of the market. We can also look at how much money was made in the stock market due to long-term trading and how much money could be saved if investors simply held for longer periods of time.

    "response": "When you hear a song on the radio, you probably don't think about all of the people who worked on it to make it possible. But in fact, many different people and companies helped create that song. They're called the rights holders. The rights holders have special agreements with each other so they can use the songs in the way they want. This is how the music industry works. It's also why you see so many names on album covers. The following sections describe what each of these rights holders is. Albums are copyrighted by the record company, so they can only be sold by the record company. Record companies own the recordings of songs. They pay artists for their performances. The artists own the rights to the lyrics and melodies of their songs. Songwriters own the rights to their songs' lyrics and melodies. Songwriters can choose to sell their songs to record companies. The songwriters may receive money for this, but not as much as the record companies do. The music publishers own the sheet music of the songs.

    "question": "why we do n't raise more bison instead of cows They seem bigger and to produce more meat per animal . Are they harder to raise , slower to mature , consume more feed ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Bisons are huge. Bulls can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand almost 6 feet tall at the shoulder. They have horns that can grow up to two feet long. Bulls also have long shaggy hair that is white on top and dark brown on the sides and bottom. Bulls are also very territorial and aggressive. They use their horns to fight each other. Bulls will sometimes charge and gore people who get too close. Even though they look scary, bulls are actually gentle giants. The only time they attack humans is if they feel threatened. Cows are much smaller than bulls and are less likely to charge. Bulls are also hard to breed. Bulls don't naturally want to mate with cows. Bulls have to be trained to breed the cows. Cows also have to be trained to let bulls breed them. It takes many years to train bulls to breed cows. Bulls also have a shorter lifespan than cows. Bulls only live for about eight to ten years. Cows can live up to twenty-five years. Bulls are also more prone to getting sick than cows. Bulls have to be vaccinated against diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and anthrax. Bulls also need more food and water than cows. Bulls need 15-20 pounds of hay a day to stay healthy. Cows only need 7-8 pounds of hay a day. Bulls also need more room than cows because they are so big. Bulls are also very expensive to buy and keep. Bulls cost $4,000-$5,000 each. Bulls are also very expensive to feed. Bulls eat twice as much feed as cows. Bulls also require special feed. Bulls are raised in pens called bison barns. Bulls have to be fed special feed that is high in protein. Bulls also have to be given antibiotics to treat and prevent diseases."

    "response": "The 2nd Amendment was written in a time when guns were made with wooden stocks and iron barrels. It would be hard for someone to argue that the 2nd Amendment means that the people should have the right to own a gun in the modern day. The 2nd Amendment also doesn't say that you can only have one gun or two guns or three guns or four guns. It says you have the right to bear arms. There is no limit to how many guns you can have. The 2nd Amendment is very simple and easy to understand. People who want to argue that they should have unlimited guns are just trying to make it harder to understand what the 2nd Amendment actually says."

    "question": "Please explain what is \"Electromagnetic radiation\"",
    "response": "form of electromagnetic radiation that consists of photons of light traveling through space at the speed of light, or 300,000 kilometers per second (186,000 miles per second). The energy of each photon is related to its wavelength by Planck's equation: h c / l = E, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and l is the wavelength. Electromagnetic radiation can be thought of as a stream of photons, each with its own energy. For example, visible light is made up of photons with wavelengths ranging from about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers. Each photon has an energy of approximately 12 electron volts (eV). The sun is a major source of electromagnetic radiation. It emits photons with a wide range of wavelengths, including visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays. The sun is so bright that it can even damage the skin. The higher the energy of the radiation, the more likely it is to cause damage. Ultraviolet radiation, which includes UVA and UVB radiation, can lead to sunburn and may increase the risk of skin cancer. X-rays and gamma rays can lead to acute radiation poisoning and may increase the risk of developing cancer. The amount of radiation reaching the earth is greatly reduced by the atmosphere. In fact, without the atmosphere, the earth would be completely destroyed by radiation. The ozone layer in the stratosphere further reduces the amount of harmful radiation that reaches the surface. The amount of radiation reaching the surface depends on the angle at which the radiation enters the atmosphere. If the radiation enters perpendicular to the atmosphere, there will be less absorption than if the radiation enters parallel to the atmosphere. The amount of radiation reaching the surface also depends on the thickness of the atmosphere. The thicker the atmosphere, the more radiation will be absorbed. The amount of radiation reaching the surface is greatest when the sun is directly overhead. This is why the desert receives more radiation than the rainforest. The amount of radiation reaching the surface also depends on the time of day. The amount of radiation reaching the surface is greatest during midday and decreases as the sun moves toward the horizon. The amount of radiation reaching the surface also depends on the season. The earth is tilted on its axis, which causes seasons. The seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth on its axis and the orbit of the earth around the sun. The tilt of the earth on its axis causes the"

    "question": "If blood is red , why does it leave a yellow trail when you smear it ? I generally find this when I 'm not bleeding in large quantities . For instance , nose bleeds sometimes . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "red color is made up of the three primary colors red, blue, and green. When light from the sun hits an object, some of the light is absorbed and some is reflected. The color we see depends on which colors are absorbed and which are reflected. Red objects absorb all colors except red, so they reflect red. Blue objects absorb all colors except blue, so they reflect blue. Green objects absorb all colors except green, so they reflect green. If you look at a rainbow, you will see all of the primary colors. Primary colors can be mixed to make other colors. Secondary colors are made by mixing two primary colors. Red + blue = purple. Red + green = orange. Blue + green = cyan. Tertiary colors are made by mixing one primary color with one secondary color. Red + cyan = magenta. Red + orange = pink. Blue + magenta = violet. Blue + orange = turquoise. Green + cyan = teal. Green + magenta = spring green. Green + orange = olive. You can mix any primary or secondary color with white to make a tint. You can mix any primary or secondary color with black to make a shade. You can mix any primary or secondary color with gray to make a tone. The color that is left after you mix two primary colors together is called complementary. Red + blue = purple. Blue + red = purple. Red + green = orange. Green + red = orange. Blue + green = cyan.

    "response": "Five. The point is that the acceleration due to gravity depends on the distance from the center of the Earth. In the case of an object falling from rest, it will accelerate at 9.8 m/s2 for the first second, 19.6 m/s2 for the second second, 29.4 m/s2 for the third second, and so on. This means that the object will be going faster and faster as time goes on. This is why objects fall faster when they are closer to the center of the Earth. The further away you are from the center of the Earth, the slower you will be going. The further away you are from the center of the Earth, the slower you will be going.

    "question": "Why is it that we ca n't tickle ourselves and laugh , but we can masturbate and reach orgasm ? I really ca n't seem to come up with a reasonable answer . But , I'm not a scientist so .. Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When you try to tickle yourself, the muscles in your body respond to the signals from your brain telling them what to do. They move before the signal even gets there. So they don't get the chance to be surprised or shocked by the tickle. The same thing happens when you laugh. Your brain tells your muscles to make the sound, but they move before the signal reaches them. You can't tickle yourself or laugh because of this. Masturbation and orgasm work differently. The part of the brain that controls sexual response doesn't need signals from the rest of the body. It works on its own. This means you can control it. The part of the brain that controls movement also doesn't need signals from the rest of the body to work. This means you can control it too. So you can decide whether or not to have an orgasm. You can't control a tickle or a laugh because those parts of the brain don't work like that."

    "response": "There are many reasons why Congress can do this. One reason is that it is difficult to pass laws in Congress. Another reason is that many of the people who have power in Congress have their own special interests. This means that when they make new laws, they often make them to help themselves or their friends. So, if a bill doesn't work the first time, they can just change some of the parts of the bill so that it will work better for them next time. The bill might be called something different, but it will still have the same idea. If the bill isn't working, the people who made it can make changes and try it again."

    "question": "why are almost all newborn creatures so \" cute \" to us ? Just about every mammal and a ton of other creatures are all very adorable and cute when they 're babies .. why is this ? ? ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When you look at baby animals, they look like little versions of their parents. For example, the baby rabbit looks like its mother. The baby deer looks like its father. The baby bird looks like its parents. This is because babies look like their parents. This makes them more attractive to the parent. It also helps them survive in the wild. Babies have big eyes, big ears, and soft fur or feathers. These features help them see, hear, and stay warm. They also make them look cute to people. Babies can't take care of themselves right away. So they need their parents to take care of them. If the parents don't like the babies, they won't take care of them. Baby animals that don't look like their parents often do not get taken care of. Animals that look like their parents usually get taken care of. This means the babies live longer. Babies also need to be able to run and hide from predators. They need to be able to find food and stay safe. When they look like their parents, they can do these things better. This means they have a better chance of surviving. So if baby animals look like their parents, they are more likely to survive. This is true for most baby animals. Some baby animals look very different from their parents. But they still look cute. Baby animals that look different from their parents usually have other ways to survive. They may have special abilities that their parents don't have. They may have special ways to find food. Or they may have special ways to hide from predators. These baby animals also look cute to people. This means they have a better chance of being taken care of. So they also have a better chance of surviving."

    "question": "Why do most black people have that black accent ? Where did they get it from ? You know what accent I 'm talking about . Where did they get it from ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "where the \"black\" accent comes from is complicated. In the 1600s and 1700s, when the first black slaves were brought to America, there was no such thing as the \"black\" accent. When the first slaves arrived in America, they came from many different places across the African continent. They spoke many different languages, some of which were not even related to each other. As a result, the slaves brought with them a variety of accents. Over time, as generations of slaves intermarried and their children were born, their children began to speak in a way that was different from their parents' accent. This was because the children grew up speaking to their parents and siblings who had different accents. Over time, the children's speech became a blend of their parents' accents. It also became similar to the accents of other people around them. So, the \"black\" accent we hear today is actually a mixture of many different accents. Some researchers believe that the \"black\" accent developed in the southern United States because slaves from different parts of Africa were brought together there. Others think that the accent developed because slaves worked together to do the same jobs, such as cotton picking. As a result, they all began to speak in a similar way. The \"black\" accent has been called many names, including the Southern accent, the African American English accent, the Black Belt accent, and the African American English accent. There are many theories about why the \"black\" accent developed, but none of them has been proven."

    "question": "Second cousin , third removed(and all that ) That whole \" _ _ _ cousin , _ _ _ removed \" thing ... I never understood it . Can anybody shed some light on this ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "1/2 or 1/4. The term cousin is used to describe people who share one set of grandparents but not necessarily one set of parents. For example, if your father's brother and sister's children are your cousins, you are first cousins with them. If your mother's brother and sister's children are your cousins, you are second cousins with them. If you have an uncle and aunt who are the children of your parents' brothers and sisters, you are third cousins with them. In the same way, your first cousins' children would be your first cousins once removed (because they are children of your first cousins), and their children would be your first cousins twice removed (because they are children of your first cousins' children). The term \"removed\" is used to indicate whether the two people share one set of grandparents (as in the first example) or two sets of grandparents (as in the second example). First cousins share only one set of grandparents; second cousins share two sets of grandparents. A more formal definition of cousin is as follows: - A first cousin is the child of one of your grandparents' siblings. - A second cousin is the child of one of your great-grandparents' siblings. - A third cousin is the child of one of your great-great-grandparents' siblings. The word \"removed\" refers to how many generations apart the two people are from having the same set of grandparents. The number of generations between the two people is determined by the number of generations between the two people's common ancestor and each of the two people's parents. For example, if you are the grandchild of your grandmother and your cousin is the grandchild of your grandmother's sister, then you are first cousins once removed because you are separated by one generation. If you are the grandson of your grandmother and your cousin is the grandchild of your grandmother's sister's sister, then you are first cousins twice removed because you are separated by two generations."

    "question": "Cases in language .. Accusative , nominative , dative , genitive , etc . I 've been trying to learn German recently and ca n't get my head around these concepts .. Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Accusative Case accusative case The accusative case is used when the verb of the sentence requires an object. In English, we use the same word order as the German accusative case (the subject + verb + object) in all sentences. In German, however, there are different word orders depending on which case is used. In the accusative case, the direct object of the verb comes after the verb. Example: Ich esse einen Apfel. (I eat an apple.) The word \"Apfel\" (apple) is the direct object of the verb \"esse\" (eat). In this sentence, \"Apfel\" is in the accusative case because it is the direct object of the verb \"esse.\" Example: Ich gebe dem Kind das Buch. (I give the child the book.) The word \"das Buch\" (the book) is the direct object of the verb \"gebe\" (give). In this sentence, \"das Buch\" is in the accusative case because it is the direct object of the verb \"gebe.\" The indirect object of a verb that takes an indirect object pronoun (mir, dir, ihm, ihr, es, uns, euch, ihnen) also uses the accusative case. Example: Ich schenke Ihnen das Buch. (I give you the book.) The word \"das Buch\" (the book) is the indirect object of the verb \"schenke\" (give). In this sentence, \"das Buch\" is in the accusative case because it is the indirect object of the verb \"schenke.\" Note: The indirect object pronoun \"Sie\" (you) does not take the accusative case in German. It is always in the dative case. The dative case is used when the verb of the sentence requires a preposition or an indirect object pronoun. In German, there are two types of dative cases: the dative absolute and the dative of location. Dative absolute The dative absolute is used with verbs of time, place, and movement. It is formed by adding \"-n\" to the end of the dative form of the verb. The dative absolute can be translated as \"at the time when,\" \"in the place where,\" or \"while.\" Example: Ich bin in Berlin gewesen. (I was in Berlin.) The word \"Berlin\" (Berlin) is the dative absolute. In this sentence, \"Berlin\" is in the dative absolute because it is the dative of"

    "response": "Amazon has an \"Affiliate\" program that allows other businesses to earn money when someone clicks on their link and buys something from Amazon. Amazon pays the affiliate company a commission on each sale. The affiliate company gets paid whether or not the customer buys the item. For example, if you buy a book at Amazon.com and it's listed as an affiliate product, Amazon will pay the affiliate company a commission even though you didn't click on the affiliate link to buy the book. This is how the affiliate company makes its money. So if you're buying a book on Amazon, there's no way for the seller to make money off of you unless the book is listed as an affiliate product. In order to list a book as an affiliate product, the seller must sign up with the affiliate program. The seller does this so that Amazon will pay them a commission every time a customer buys the book. When you buy a book on Amazon, you may see the option to add it to your cart. If you choose to add the book to your cart, you'll be asked to sign up for Amazon's affiliate program. This is what you do if you want to earn money by selling books on Amazon. The affiliate program doesn't allow sellers to sell books for less than the wholesale price. So if a book is sold for less than the wholesale price, it probably isn't being sold by the author or publisher. The seller could be selling books that were donated or purchased at a discount. They may also be using a special deal with Amazon to get books at a lower price. In some cases, the seller might be using Amazon's affiliate program to sell books that aren't listed anywhere else. For example, the seller might have a collection of rare books that he's never been able to find a buyer for. He might decide to sell these books through Amazon's affiliate program. The seller will receive a commission every time someone buys one of his books. If you're buying a book from Amazon, you don't need to worry about the seller making money off you. You'll be charged the regular price for the book, plus any shipping and handling fees."

In the first method, the electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy before amplification takes place. In the second method, the electrical energy is amplified before conversion into mechanical energy.

    "response": "Rationalizing is a way of making a fraction simpler. When you have a square root in the denominator, it can be hard to do arithmetic with that number. So, if you can make the denominator a whole number, then it will be easier to work with. For example, you may find it easier to multiply 1/3 * 1/5 than 1/ sqrt3 * 1/ sqrt5. The second one takes longer to figure out. You might think that the first one would take longer, but you just need to multiply 1 * 1 and 3 * 5. If you rationalize the denominator, you can do this. The first example gives you 1/15. The second example gives you sqrt15/15. Both examples give you the same result. So, you can choose which one you prefer."

    "question": "When you take a shower , why does the shower curtain get pulled into the shower and annoy you ? Should n't the hot air push the curtain out ? Was unsure to post on here , or r / showerthoughts Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Shower curtains should not pull into the shower. There is no reason for this to happen. If you have one, please check it and fix it. If you don't have one, you can still try to understand what's going on. The reason for the shower curtain to pull in is because of the warm air from the shower. This warm air rises and moves towards the ceiling. It is lighter than the cooler air around it so it rises and gets trapped between the curtain and the wall. When the curtain is pulled back, the air escapes. This causes the curtain to be pulled back into the shower. To fix this problem, you can use a shower curtain that has an edge that sticks up a little bit. This way, when the warm air rises, it will hit the edge and not go over the curtain. You can also use a shower curtain that has a suction cup on the bottom. This way, the warm air will stick to the bottom of the curtain and not escape. You can also use a shower curtain that has a suction cup on the bottom. This way, the warm air will stick to the bottom of the curtain and not escape.

    "response": "It's not clear what would happen if you swallowed a gold flake or other small piece of metal. If you swallowed a coin, your stomach acids wouldn't digest it. It might sit there for a long time. But it probably wouldn't hurt you. If you swallowed a piece of metal smaller than a coin, it might pass through your digestive system without problems. The same thing is likely true for a gold flake. But some metals can cut your intestine and cause serious bleeding. The risk depends on the size of the piece of metal. For example, a nail or screw could cut your intestine. A larger piece of metal might not cut your intestine, but it could block your intestines. So if you swallow something small, like a piece of metal, you should talk with your doctor right away."

    "question": "If radiation can cause cancer how is it used to cure cancer ? I understand how it causes cancer , but how is radiation used to cure cancer without just creating more cancerous cells ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing. Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external radiation therapy) or from putting radioactive material together with tissues inside the body (internal radiation therapy). External radiation therapy is the most common way to treat cancer. It may be used alone or with other types of treatment, such as chemotherapy and/or surgery. Internal radiation therapy is used less often than external radiation therapy. It may be used to treat some cancers of the head and neck. It may also be used to treat certain types of lung cancer and prostate cancer. Internal radiation therapy is also called implantation or brachytherapy. Radiation therapy is used to treat many types of cancer. Some people have radiation therapy before surgery to shrink a tumor. Other people have radiation therapy after surgery to destroy cancer cells that may remain in the body. Radiation therapy may also be used after surgery to treat any remaining cancer cells. This is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy may be used to treat some cancers that cannot be treated with surgery or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is used to treat many types of cancer.

    "question": "What 's up with DRMs and why are people always so keen to have DRM free versions of software / files ? I think it 's partly to do with copyright issues but that 's all I know . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When you buy a song from iTunes or Amazon Music, the music company owns the rights to the song, not you. If you want to make copies of the song, you need to get permission from the music company. The same goes for movies and TV shows. If you want to make copies of those, you need to get permission from the movie or TV show company. DRM is a way to make sure that no one makes copies of copyrighted songs, movies, and TV shows without permission. If you buy a copy of a song or movie on an iPod or other device, the device will automatically play the music or watch the movie. But the music or movie won't be able to be copied or shared with others. This means that if you buy a copy of a song or movie on your device, you can listen to or watch it many times, but you can't share it with others. DRM also helps protect the copyright holder's profits. If someone could easily copy songs and movies, the music and movie companies would make less money. So they use DRM to help protect their copyrights. But DRM also has its problems. Some people believe that DRM is unfair because it stops them from making copies of songs or movies to share with their friends. Others believe that DRM prevents them from using their devices in certain ways, such as playing music while jogging. DRM also costs extra money for the companies that make the music and movies. In order to make DRM work, these companies need to pay extra to create special technology that makes copying difficult. This extra cost may end up being passed on to you, the consumer. Some people think that DRM isn't necessary because it's not very effective at stopping people from making copies. For example, some people have found ways to remove DRM from songs and movies. Other people just don't use DRM at all. They download their music and movies from sites that don't use DRM. If you're not sure whether a song or movie uses DRM, you can check to see if it's \"DRM-free\" or \"DRM-protected.\" To find out if a song or movie is DRM-free, you can look at the \"Buy\" page for the song or movie. If the \"Buy\" page says that the song or movie is DRM-free, you can buy it without having to worry about the DRM. If the \"Buy\" page doesn't say that the song or movie is DRM-free, you should ask the seller if the song or movie is DRM-free. If the seller doesn't know,"

    "question": "Babyfood jar VS real food discoloration Explain to me why a jar of banana baby food does not insta - turns brown just like a real life banana ? The jar states nothing is added ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Bananas turn brown when they're cut open and exposed to air. That's because the enzyme in the fruit, called polyphenol oxidase, reacts with oxygen in the air to make it brown. But if you cook bananas or freeze them, this reaction stops. In the case of baby food, the bananas are cooked and frozen before being processed into baby food. So, even though there is no additional color additive in the baby food, it still has all the same properties as a fresh banana. As a result, it will brown when exposed to air."

    "question": "How we know the size and revenue of an illegal industry Just read an article about sex trafficking , which is supposedly grosses 9.5 billion in the US and 32 billion worldwide yearly . Where do these numbers come from ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "It's hard to know the exact size of an illegal industry. But there are some ways that researchers estimate the size of the underground economy. The first way is to look at the tax revenue lost because of the activity. For example, if 10% of all cigarettes sold in the United States were smuggled into the country, it would mean the government was losing $6 billion a year in taxes. The second way is to use estimates of how many people are involved in the activity. If 10% of all the women in the world are sex trafficked, that means 47 million women are being trafficked. The third way is to use information from victims who have escaped the activity. Victims can tell us how much money they made. They also can tell us what percentage of their earnings went to pay for the work. So if one victim said she made $10,000 a month and 80% of her earnings went to pay for the work, then she made $2,000 a month from the work. We can use this information to estimate the total size of the industry."

    "question": "Why can organisms lift more than their body weight ? This is very simple and we see examples of it all the time with ants , human weightlifting , etc . but it would be great to hear some different ways of explaining it . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "There's a lot of science behind why an ant can carry a load many times its own weight, or why a person can lift weights far heavier than he weighs. But for now, just know that there are two reasons: gravity and leverage. Gravity pulls everything down toward Earth's center, which makes it easier to lift heavy things when you're standing up straight. (When you bend over, your body has less leverage to lift a heavy object.) And the longer you extend your arms, the more leverage you have. The same principle explains how you can lift a heavy box without bending over. You simply stand up straight and extend your arms as far out as possible, so that your hands are as far away from your body as possible. This gives you lots of leverage to lift the box. You can also use leverage to lift a heavy thing if you stand on something high enough, like a stool or a ladder. Even if you don't have a ladder, you can still use leverage. For example, if you put one foot on a step, then lift a heavy thing with your other hand, you'll find that you have more leverage and can lift the thing much more easily. This is what people do when they use a crowbar to move a heavy piece of furniture. They use the crowbar as a lever to lift the heavy thing. Another way to get leverage is to use a tool that magnifies your strength, such as a wrench or pliers. These tools help you lift heavy objects without having to use as much force yourself. You can also use leverage to lift heavy things by using a machine. A machine can amplify your strength, and you don't even have to use any force at all. Machines work by converting your input force into output force in a way that lets you lift heavy things without having to use as much strength yourself."

She just moved up to drinking 3 oz every two hours. She used to drink 2. He also told me she had light grey and green poop. She pooped three times today. What s wrong?",
    "response": "The baby is having diarrhea. The diarrhea is most likely caused by gastroenteritis (gah-tro-en-ter-IT-is). Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and intestines. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Bacteria that cause gastroenteritis include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7. Viruses that cause gastroenteritis include rotavirus, astrovirus, and norovirus. Parasites that cause gastroenteritis include Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Diarrhea usually lasts 1 to 2 days. Most children with gastroenteritis get better without treatment. If your child has diarrhea, you may need to change how you feed him or her. Also, make sure he or she gets plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. The diarrhea will go away on its own in 1 to 2 days. Your child should be able to return to his or her normal diet within 24 to 48 hours. If the diarrhea continues after 2 days, call your doctor. The diarrhea may be caused by a bacterial infection. A bacterial infection requires antibiotics. If your child has diarrhea that lasts longer than 4 days, call your doctor. Your child may have a different condition that needs treatment.

    "question": "why are Europe and Asia two separate continents if they are on the same landmass ? I 'm so confused Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Asia and Europe are not connected and they have their own geographies. The separation between Asia and Europe is caused by the Ural Mountains. This mountain range divides the Eurasian continent into two parts: Asia and Europe. The Ural Mountains are a natural barrier that separates these two continents. It's important to note that the Ural Mountains do not form a continuous line of mountains but rather a series of ranges and hills. This means that there are gaps in the mountain range where people can travel from one continent to another. Despite this, the Ural Mountains are still considered a significant physical feature that has separated Asia and Europe for thousands of years. The separation between Asia and Europe is also caused by the fact that the two continents have different climates, cultures, and histories. Asia is a vast continent with a diverse range of climates, while Europe is a smaller continent with more uniform climates. There are also differences in the languages spoken in the two continents, with many Asian countries using languages that are not commonly spoken in Europe. These differences in culture and history have contributed to the perception that Asia and Europe are separate continents. However, it's important to remember that the Ural Mountains are just one factor that has contributed to the separation between Asia and Europe. Other factors such as trade routes, migration patterns, and political decisions have also played a role in shaping the way the two continents are perceived."

Some female serial killers have been found to have lower than normal levels of testosterone. Others have been found to have high levels of testosterone. There is no single cause of serial killing. There are many different reasons why people kill. Many factors play a role in whether someone becomes a serial killer. These include: Genetic and environmental factors. Brain chemistry. Mental health problems. Social influences. The way society treats people who have certain mental illnesses or who are at risk for developing them. Other factors. Researchers are continuing to study the causes of serial killing. They hope to learn more about it so they can find ways to prevent it."

    "question": "How do we know that no two snowflakes are alike ? This is what gets me : what if there ARE duplicates or types that we just have n't been able to collect and observe because ... you know ... blizzards and mountaintops ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Well, here's the science of it: No two snowflakes are alike. The reason for this is simple. Snowflakes form from ice crystals in clouds. As these crystals fall through the cloud, they collide with other ice crystals and water droplets. When they do, they exchange some of their water molecules and grow. This process happens over and over again as the crystals fall through the cloud. Each time the crystals fall, they take on new shapes based on their interactions with other crystals and water droplets. So even if two crystals start out as identical, they will be different once they reach the ground. In fact, no two snowflakes can be identical. There are many factors that influence how a snowflake will look. For example, the temperature at which the crystal falls through the cloud determines its size. If the temperature is very cold, the crystal will be larger. If the temperature is warmer, the crystal will be smaller. The humidity also affects the shape of the crystal. If the air is humid, the crystal will be larger. If the air is dry, the crystal will be smaller. All of these factors combine to create a unique snowflake. So, while it may seem like there could be a few duplicate snowflakes, there really can't be any. If there were, we would have discovered them by now!"

The tip of the tongue is the most sensitive part of the tongue to taste, and is also the part of the tongue that is most likely to be affected by oral diseases such as dental decay, ulcers, or cancer. The tongue also has many other important functions including speech, chewing, and swallowing. The tongue is made up of muscles and nerve tissue. It is covered with a mucous membrane, which helps protect the tongue from damage and keeps it moist. The tongue also has taste buds, which allow you to taste different flavors. If you have trouble tasting certain foods or if your tongue feels sore or swollen, see your dentist. The tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth by a structure called the frenulum. The frenulum can sometimes become irritated or infected, causing pain or swelling. A dentist can treat this problem. The tongue is also connected to the jaw by several small bones called the maxilla and mandible. These bones help support the tongue and keep it in place while you chew and speak.

    "response": "No alcoholic beverages should be consumed until you are completely free of symptoms of bronchitis. Alcohol can cause irritation of your airways and make coughing worse. Caffeine may also worsen your cough. Therefore, try to avoid caffeine in the form of coffee, tea, or colas. If you smoke, quit smoking. Smoking can worsen your cough and delay healing. Smoking can also increase your risk of complications. The American Lung Association has information about quitting smoking at www.lung.org. It's important to drink plenty of fluids during the course of your illness. This will help thin the mucus and make it easier to cough up. Drink liquids such as water, juice, and clear broths. Avoid milk and milk products because they can thicken mucus. Also avoid carbonated drinks. These can irritate your airways and make coughing worse. If you have a fever, you may also need to drink more fluids than usual to prevent dehydration. If you're coughing up green or yellow phlegm, you may have an infection that needs treatment with antibiotics. Follow your health care provider's advice on how much fluid to drink. You may want to keep a glass of cool water by your bedside at night. This can help you stay hydrated and relieve your cough if it gets worse."

    "response": "A big asteroid or comet could hit Earth. The space rock may come from the sun's neighborhood of planets called the asteroid belt. Or it may come from farther away in the solar system. It may be traveling very fast. Some people think that the dinosaurs went extinct because of an asteroid or comet hit Earth. It may have been a huge impact like this: Asteroids and comets can hurtle through space at speeds of 20 to 72 miles per second (32 to 116 kilometers per second). This is much faster than a speeding bullet. It would take about 15 minutes for an asteroid traveling at 20 miles per second (32 kilometers per second) to reach Earth. At this speed, the asteroid would travel more than 4 times around the Earth in one hour! That's pretty fast! The force of an impact depends on the size of the space rock. A large object hitting Earth would cause a lot of damage. A small object might not cause much damage. The asteroid or comet may break apart into many pieces before it hits Earth. It may explode in the atmosphere before it reaches the ground. Or it may crash into Earth with little warning. It may be hard to know when an asteroid or comet will hit Earth. This makes it difficult to protect Earth from impacts. Scientists are working on ways to find out if an asteroid or comet will hit Earth. They want to learn how to warn people ahead of time so they can prepare. Scientists also want to know what happens after an asteroid or comet hits Earth. For example, scientists want to know if the impact will make Earth too hot or too cold to live on. If so, they'll want to learn how to protect people from the effects of the impact. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?"

    "question": "How are programming bugs made ? Everytime I searched for this question , I kept getting questions about actual bugs ... Anyways , as someone with pretty much 0 programming knowledge , how are bugs made ? Why is it so difficult to create something without bugs ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "It's very hard to make a computer program that doesn't have any bugs in it. The reason is that a program is usually just a bunch of instructions written in code. These instructions tell the computer what to do. It's up to you to make sure your instructions are correct. If you write an instruction that makes no sense or isn't clear, then the computer may not be able to understand it and will give an error message. If the error message isn't clear, then you won't know what went wrong. If you don't fix the problem, then the program may stop working correctly. Sometimes a bug is caused because you're trying to do too many things at once. For example, if you try to print a document on a printer while you're also typing on a keyboard, the program might not work correctly. Or, if you try to open two windows at the same time, you might get an error message. Another reason a program might not work correctly is because you're using the wrong information. For example, if you try to add numbers but you're actually trying to subtract them, then the computer will add the wrong numbers and give you an incorrect answer. Or, if you're trying to use a name for a variable but you accidentally use a number, the computer will think you're trying to add a number to a string of letters. This can cause problems with the program. Also, sometimes a program has errors because it was written by more than one person. When people work together on a program, it's very easy to forget to change the same piece of code. For example, if one programmer changes a piece of code but another programmer doesn't change it, then the program will still have the old code. Sometimes a program has errors because the programmers didn't test it well enough. If they don't test the program carefully enough, then they might miss some errors. Sometimes a program has errors because it uses too much memory. For example, if you try to run a program that needs 10 megabytes of memory but only have 5 megabytes available, then the program will stop working. Sometimes a program has errors because the programmers forgot to put in error-checking code. For example, if you try to add two numbers but one of the numbers is not a number, then the program will give an error message. Sometimes a program has errors because the programmers forgot to check for errors. For example, if you try to add two numbers but one of the numbers is not a number, then the"

    "question": "What does the hot pocket sleeve actually do ? I made a hot pocket without it , and it came out just fine , so what does the sleeve do ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The hot pocket sleeve is a plastic wrapper that goes around the filling in a hot pocket. It is used to keep the filling hot for longer periods of time. The plastic wrapper keeps the heat inside the pocket, while allowing the air outside to escape. This helps to maintain the temperature of the filling inside the pocket. The plastic wrapper also prevents the filling from sticking to the pocket. This can help prevent the filling from becoming dry and hard. The plastic wrapper is usually made of polyethylene or other similar materials. These materials are chosen because they are flexible, strong, and durable. They can also be recycled after use. The plastic wrapper is often printed with information about the filling, such as the name of the product and the ingredients. This information helps consumers to identify the filling and make informed decisions about their health. The plastic wrapper is also used to protect the filling from contamination. It helps to keep the filling clean and free from bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling fresh. It helps to maintain the quality of the filling and prevent it from spoiling. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling safe. It helps to prevent the filling from being damaged during transportation and storage. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling secure. It helps to prevent the filling from falling out of the pocket during transportation and storage. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling comfortable. It helps to prevent the filling from being too hot or too cold. It also helps to prevent the filling from being too dry or too moist. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling enjoyable. It helps to prevent the filling from being too salty or too sweet. It also helps to prevent the filling from being too spicy or too bland. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling interesting. It helps to prevent the filling from being too boring or too exciting. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling interesting. It helps to prevent the filling from being too predictable or too unpredictable. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling interesting. It helps to prevent the filling from being too familiar or too unfamiliar. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling interesting. It helps to prevent the filling from being too common or too uncommon. The plastic wrapper is also used to keep the filling interesting. It helps to prevent the filling from being too ordinary or too extraordinary.

    "question": "LI5 : Photons Like I 'm a very scientifically eager 5 year old : How can * light * be reduced to / quantified as a particle ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Light Is Particles and Waves Light is made up of tiny pieces called photons. Photons are the same as quanta, which means small amounts of energy. Light travels in waves. The wavelength is the distance between one wave and the next. The frequency is the number of waves that pass a point in a certain amount of time. Light travels at a constant speed. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second. This is about 670 million miles per hour! This is faster than any other thing in the universe! The speed of light is so fast that it takes years for its light to travel across the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way galaxy is about 100,000 light years across. That's a really big number! It takes light from the center of our galaxy 100,000 years to reach the edge of the galaxy. If we look at pictures of galaxies, they look fuzzy because we're seeing them as they were millions or billions of years ago. Light is also made up of particles called photons. Photons have no mass but do have energy and momentum. They also have electric and magnetic fields associated with them. Photons can be absorbed or emitted by an atom. When they are absorbed, the atom gains energy. When they are emitted, the atom loses energy. Light can be red-shifted or blue-shifted. Red-shifted light has longer wavelengths. Blue-shifted light has shorter wavelengths. Red-shifted light looks redder than normal light. Blue-shifted light looks bluer than normal light. Red-shifted light is coming from a distant galaxy. Blue-shifted light is coming from something that is moving towards us. The Big Bang Theory says that the universe was very hot and dense at first. As the universe cooled down, it expanded and cooled even more. The expansion of the universe causes red-shifted light. As the universe expands, the light gets pushed further apart. The farther the light is pushed apart, the redder it looks. Light can be polarized. Polarization happens when light waves line up in one direction. Polarized sunglasses block polarized light. Polarized sunglasses make glare from water, snow, or glass less bright. Light can be refracted. Refraction is when light changes direction as it passes through a medium. Light is refracted when it moves from air into water. Light moves slower in water than in air. Light is refracted when it moves from water into air. Light"

    "question": "Why are most vegetarians perfectly ok with eating cheese when a large variety are made with rennet ? ( An enzyme extracted from the stomach of a calf . ) This has always bothered me just a little . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Cheese is made from milk. The milk comes from animals. Some people do not eat animal products. These people are called vegetarians. They do not eat meat or eggs or other animal products. Most vegetarians are fine with eating cheese. They think it is okay because the milk that is used to make cheese comes from plants, not animals. The milk for cheese comes from cows, goats, and sheep. But the plants that these animals eat are not animals. The plants have no feelings. They are not hurt in any way. So the vegetarian does not feel bad about eating cheese. The only exception is cheese that uses rennet. Rennet is a special kind of enzyme. It comes from the stomachs of young calves. This means that some cheese must be avoided by vegetarians. This is because the cheese may use rennet. There are many types of cheese that use rennet. Some examples are: Gorgonzola Dairymaid Blue Wisconsin Bleu de Champagne Stilton Camembert Brie Roquefort Cheddar Goat cheese Parmigiano-Reggiano Ricotta Cheese is also made from plant products. This type of cheese is usually safe for vegetarians to eat. Examples are: Mozzarella Cottage cheese Tofu (a food made from soybeans) Paneer cheese (a food made from curds) Many other types of cheese are made without using rennet. These cheeses are safe for vegetarians to eat."

    "response": "1. Medications that are used to treat fatty liver disease include: - Ursodeoxycholic acid - Ursodiol - Cholestyramine - Niacin - Levocarnitine - Folic acid supplements - Weight loss surgery 2. The following lifestyle changes can help prevent fatty liver disease from getting worse or from occurring in the first place: - Maintain a healthy weight - Avoid alcohol - Eat healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains - Exercise regularly - Quit smoking - Limit your intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and salt - Follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans - Ask your doctor about taking vitamins A, D, E, and K and folate Supplements may be needed if you have low levels of these vitamins. - Ask your doctor about taking vitamin B12 Supplements may be needed if you have low levels of this vitamin. - Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor. - Check with your doctor before taking over-the-counter medicines. Some over-the-counter medicines can cause liver problems. - Ask your doctor about taking herbal supplements. Some herbs can harm your liver. - If you take medicines to treat high blood pressure or cholesterol, ask your doctor whether you need to adjust the dose. Some people who take these medicines have had serious side effects. - Ask your doctor about taking acetaminophen. This pain reliever is safe in moderate doses but can damage the liver if taken in large amounts. - If you take acetaminophen, don't take it along with other medicines that contain acetaminophen. For example, don't take acetaminophen with ibuprofen. - Don't drink alcohol. Alcohol is toxic to the liver. It also can make fatty liver disease worse. Alcohol also can lead to alcoholic hepatitis, which is a serious form of liver disease. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking is linked to many health problems, including fatty liver disease. - Get vaccinated against hepatitis A and B. These viruses can cause serious liver problems. - Ask your doctor about taking antibiotics. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. People with chronic hepatitis C who have cirrhosis have a higher risk of developing liver cancer. Taking antibiotics may lower the risk of liver cancer. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking antibiotics."

For example, 2 + 3 x 4 = 14. However, if we did not follow the order of operations, then we could add 2 and 3 first and get 5, then multiply by 4 to get 20. This would be incorrect! So, the order of operations makes sure that everyone gets the same answer when solving an equation. In the alternate universe where people use S A D M E P, they would solve equations the opposite way. So, 2 + 3 x 4 = 14 would be solved as follows: 2 + 3 x 4 = 14 6 x 4 = 14 24 = 14 This would be wrong! So, the order of operations is necessary to make sure everyone gets the same answer when solving an equation."

    "question": "Financing Education through Credit Card or Student Loans",
    "response": "cards can be used to pay for goods and services at stores, restaurants, gas stations, and other locations. Some card issuers offer a line of credit that you can use to make purchases up to a certain amount without paying interest. You can also use the card to withdraw cash from an ATM. The line of credit is typically linked to your checking account and is available when you need it. You can use the line of credit as much as you want until the limit is reached. Some card issuers allow you to carry a balance from month to month with no interest, but you may have to pay a fee for this privilege. This line of credit is not a loan. You do not have to repay the money until you choose to do so. You can also use the line of credit to make purchases online. You can even set up automatic payments to pay off the balance each month.

These regulations have been in place since 2013. This is because the cost of sending money internationally is very high. However, the costs can be reduced if you use a service like MoneyGram or Western Union. Also, it's important to note that some banks offer international money transfer services at a lower cost. This is because they have agreements with certain money transfer companies to offer their customers a discount on these services. These discounts can range from 10% to 50%.

    "response": "No, power plants don't store power. When you use electricity at home, it comes from a power plant that generates it. The power plant makes the electricity right there. When you're not using electricity, the power plant keeps making it. That's how the power company can keep supplying electricity to your house all day long, even when you're not using it. When you turn on your lights, your TV, or your computer, you're using electricity. Electricity travels through wires to your house. The electricity that travels to your house is called \"line voltage.\" Line voltage is just electricity. It doesn't have to be stored anywhere. The power company sends line voltage to your house as soon as you ask for it. So the power company doesn't need to store any power. The only thing that needs to be stored is the cost of the electricity you use. The power company bills you based on how much electricity you used. If you use more electricity than usual, the power company charges you more money. The power company can't charge you for the electricity that you don't use because the power company doesn't store it."

    "question": "What causes lump in the side of neck?Hi I have had a  painless lump on lower right side of neck posterior triange i think, it is hard and moveable, blood work came back fine and no other symtoms doctor said it would go away itself but may take a few weeks, lump is still there and wondering should i get it checked again",
    "response": "There are many reasons for a lump to develop in the neck area. Most of these are not serious and can be treated or managed at home. Some lumps are more serious and require treatment. A lump that develops on the side of your neck could be a lipoma, which is a fatty tumor that develops under the skin. Lipomas are common and usually harmless. However, they can become larger and cause pain if they grow close to nerves or muscles. Lipomas can also develop in other areas of the body such as the chest, abdomen, and back. A lipoma may feel soft or rubbery when touched. It may also move slightly when you touch it. Lipomas do not spread to other parts of the body. They are not cancerous. If you have a lipoma, your doctor will probably remove it. He or she will use a needle to remove the entire lipoma. In some cases, however, surgery is needed to remove the lipoma. An enlarged lymph node is another reason for a lump to develop in the neck area. Lymph nodes are small structures that help fight infection. Enlarged lymph nodes may be painful. Lymph nodes swell during an infection, such as a cold or flu. They often return to their normal size after the infection has gone away. However, swollen lymph nodes that don't go away may be caused by cancer or other serious illnesses. A tumor is a mass of tissue that forms from abnormal cell growth. Tumors can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). Malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. The most common type of cancer that begins in the neck area is thyroid cancer. Other cancers that begin in the neck include lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and naso-oropharyngeal cancer. These cancers can spread to the lymph nodes in the neck. If you have a lump in the neck area, your doctor will try to find out its cause. He or she will ask about your medical history and perform a physical exam. He or she may also recommend imaging tests, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasounds. These tests can help your doctor see the lump and rule out other problems. He or she may also need to do a biopsy. This test removes cells or tissues from the lump so they can be looked at under a microscope. A biopsy can show whether a lump is cancerous or not. Your"

    "question": "why my hair is blonde but my beard is red ? EDIT : [ Here 's a pic of my calico fur ] ( URL_0 ) and thanks for all of the responses ! Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Red hair in humans is a dominant trait, while blond hair is recessive. The red-haired trait is caused by a mutation that occurs on the X chromosome, so it only shows up in males who have one X chromosome with the mutation and one normal X chromosome. Males with this mutation will have red hair. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need to inherit two copies of the mutated gene to show red hair. Because females normally inherit one mutated gene from each parent, they have a 25% chance of being born with red hair. In contrast, if you inherit only one copy of the mutated gene from either parent, you'll have blonde hair. So, in summary, red hair is passed down through the X chromosome, while blonde hair is not. If you're male and have red hair, you inherited a copy of the mutated gene from your mother. If you're female and have red hair, you inherited a copy of the mutated gene from your father. If you're male and have blonde hair, you inherited a normal copy of the gene from your mother. If you're female and have blonde hair, you inherited one normal copy of the gene from your mother and one mutated copy of the gene from your father."

    "question": "what is the definition of a map",
    "response": "A map is a graphic representation of an area that combines topographic features and other elements in a way that provides a visual picture of the landscape. A map can be used to show how much land is being used for various purposes (such as agriculture or housing), where bodies of water are located, and so on. Maps can also be used to show the location of buildings, roads, and other structures. Maps can be created using different types of data, including aerial photography, satellite imagery, and ground-based surveys. Maps can also be created using computer software. The type of data used to create a map and the software used to create it will determine the quality of the map. Maps can be created at different scales, from large-scale maps (which show small areas in detail) to small-scale maps (which show large areas with less detail). Maps can also be created with different levels of accuracy. The level of accuracy is determined by the quality of the data used to create the map and the quality of the software used to create it. Maps can also be created with different levels of detail. The level of detail is determined by the amount of information included in the map. Maps can also be created with different colors. The colors used in a map can help to distinguish between different types of features on the map. Maps can also be created with different symbols. The symbols used in a map can help to distinguish between different types of features on the map. Maps can also be created with different projections. The projections used in a map can help to distinguish between different types of features on the map. Maps can also be created with different resolutions.

    "question": "Why ca n't you recharge plain old batteries ? What makes a battery rechargeable ? Why ca n't normal AA or other battery be recharged ? Edit : Answered ! Thank you ! Some great analogies used here ! ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The key to rechargeable batteries is the ability to add energy to a battery and remove it when needed. This requires two parts: 1) The ability to store energy in a battery; 2) The ability to release stored energy from the battery. In order to charge a battery, we need to find a way to store energy in the battery and release it at will. The first part of this process involves charging the battery. We charge a battery by putting electrical energy into the battery. In order to put energy into a battery, we must provide an external source of electricity (such as a power supply). This allows us to put energy into the battery. In order for the battery to accept the energy, it must have an external connection to the external power supply. The second part of this process involves discharging the battery. We discharge a battery by taking the stored energy out of the battery. In order to take the energy out of the battery, we must disconnect the battery from its external connection to the external power supply. The battery can then use the energy that was stored in it to do work. The most common way to charge and discharge a battery is with a simple circuit consisting of a battery, a light bulb, and a switch. The switch controls whether or not the light bulb is on or off. When the switch is open, there is no path for electrons to flow through the light bulb. Therefore, the light bulb does not light up. When the switch is closed, there is a path for electrons to flow through the light bulb. As a result, the light bulb lights up. The amount of energy that the light bulb uses depends on how long the switch is closed. If the switch is closed for a short time, the light bulb only glows dimly. If the switch is closed for a long time, the light bulb shines brightly. Batteries are similar to light bulbs in that they contain chemical reactions that allow them to store and release energy. However, unlike light bulbs, batteries can store and release energy over a longer period of time. The most important difference between light bulbs and batteries is that light bulbs require an external power supply to operate. Batteries can produce their own power without an external power supply. This allows batteries to store energy in a chemical reaction and release energy when needed. Batteries are able to store energy because they have a positive electrode (anode) and a negative electrode (cathode). The positive and negative electrodes are separated by an electrolyte. An electrolyte is a material that"

    "response": "Hot water makes better ice cubes because it is more likely to contain dissolved air bubbles. When the ice forms from the hot water, those bubbles are trapped inside the ice. The bubbles can't escape, so the ice will be less dense. Less dense means the ice floats in the water. When you place the ice cube in a drink, it will melt more slowly. That's why hot water makes better ice cubes."

    "question": "When the market price for a stock is below a tender offer's price, is it free money (riskless) to buy shares & tender them?",
    "response": "In this article, we explain why tender offers can be a good deal and when they might not be. For a more in-depth look at how tender offers work, check out How Do Tender Offers Work. In general, if you think that a company is undervalued and you believe that its management will make good use of your money, then you should consider tendering your shares. If the price offered by the company is higher than the market price, then you will likely make money from the deal. However, if the company does not accept all of your shares or if the price is lower than the market price, then you will likely lose money. Also, if the company does not have enough cash on hand to pay the tender price, then the deal may not go through and you will have to sell your shares at the market price instead. So, in summary, if you think that a company is undervalued and you believe that its management will make good use of your money, then you should consider tendering your shares. If the price offered by the company is higher than the market price, then you will likely make money from the deal. However, if the company does not accept all of your shares or if the price is lower than the market price, then you will likely lose money. Also, if the company does not have enough cash on hand to pay the tender price, then the deal may not go through and you will have to sell your shares at the market price instead."

    "question": "Why do computers run into problems the longer they are on , and why does turning them off and on again usually fix the issue ? Turning a computer off and on again is usually a common solution , and I 've always wondered why . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "A computer runs into problems because it has to deal with many things at once. It has to read information from the hard drive, write information to the hard drive, process that information, and send it out over the Internet or to another computer. All of these things can be done at the same time. When you turn a computer off and on again, you give it a clean start. The computer is turned off so it can't do any of its tasks, then it is turned back on so it can do those tasks again. This gives the computer a chance to get rid of all the old information that may have gotten mixed up in the system. Turning a computer on and off again also allows the computer to use new memory that was just installed. If the computer doesn't have enough memory, it will slow down and may crash. Turning the computer on and off again can fix this problem by giving the computer a fresh start."

    "question": "When using self - checkout registers / till , how do they prevent fraud without checking ID or having a signature ? referring to cards that does n't require pin Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The self-checkout system is designed so that the customer can check out and pay for their purchases without interacting with a cashier. The self-checkout system prevents fraud because it requires customers to place their purchased items on the conveyor belt in front of the camera which takes pictures of each item. If a customer tries to check out with an item that is not theirs, the system will not let them complete their transaction. The self-checkout system also prevents fraud because it requires the customer to enter a PIN number which must match the one that was used when the card was issued. This ensures that only the cardholder can use the card to make purchases."

    "question": "Why do buildings have gravel on top of them ? A lot of big city buildings will have a layer of gravel on top of them . Why is this ? Does it serve a purpose or is it just left over material from building ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "This is called a \"roof garden\" or \"green roof\". It's not just leftover material, but a way to save money and energy. The plants help cool the building in the summer by shading the roof and evaporative cooling from the plants. The plants also filter rainwater before it reaches the ground, which reduces the need for a septic system. The plants absorb some of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere, which helps reduce the greenhouse effect. The plants also provide shade for the people who work in the building, reducing their need for air conditioning. The plants also help prevent soil erosion. Some people think that having a roof garden will add to the beauty of a city. In many cities, there are laws about what kind of roof gardens can be built. Some of these laws are very strict. The roof garden can only be built if the roof is flat. It can't be built on a sloped roof. The roof garden must be at least 20% covered with plants. The plants must be native to the area. The plants can't be invasive. The plants can't grow tall enough to block the view from the building. The roof garden can't be built without permission from the city. The roof garden must be maintained by the person who owns the building. The roof garden must be inspected every year. If the roof garden is not maintained, it could cause problems with the roof. If the roof garden is not inspected, it could be damaged by the weather. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to park cars or store things. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to play. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to relax. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to smoke cigarettes. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to have parties. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to eat food. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to have pets. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to have children. The roof garden can't be used as a place for people to have plants.

    "question": "UK sole trader who often buys products/services on behalf of clients – do I deduct from declared income or claim as allowable expenses?",
    "response": "If you're an individual taxpayer, you can use the IRS's tax withholding calculator to estimate how much you'll owe in taxes and how much you should have withheld from your paychecks throughout the year. The amount you withhold is based on your filing status and the number of allowances you claim. You can adjust your withholding by changing the number of allowances you claim or by making additional pre-tax contributions to your 401(k), IRA, or other retirement plan. (If you're self-employed, you can use the Self-Employed Persons Withholding Estimator to estimate your estimated quarterly payments.) 2. If you're a business owner, you may be able to take advantage of tax deductions for your business expenses. For example, you can deduct the cost of equipment, supplies, and travel expenses that you incur while running your business. You can also deduct certain home office expenses if you work from home. 3. If you're self-employed, you may be eligible for a variety of tax credits and incentives, such as the earned income credit and the small business health insurance tax credit. You can find more information about these and other tax credits and incentives at the Internal Revenue Service's website. 4. If you're an employee, you may be able to claim a tax deduction for contributions you make to a qualified retirement plan, such as a 401(k) or an IRA.

    "response": "The number of games played in the regular season has changed over time. The NFL began with 6 seasons in 1920. It was expanded to 8 seasons in 1934. In 1940, it became a 10-season schedule, and then 12 in 1978. After that, it went back to 10 for a few years, but now it is 16 games each season. The number of games played changes every year, so sometimes teams will have more wins than others. The NFL also added an extra playoff game in 1990, which helped to change the balance between teams. This meant that some teams were not able to win as many games because they had to play an extra game. Now, some teams will have more wins than others because of the number of games played."

    "response": "Because of the way the Catholic Church has been run over the years, many people think that they have to believe what the Pope says. This is not true. The Catholic Church does not have any special knowledge that would give it any right to tell us what to believe or how to live our lives. The Pope is just a man who happens to be the leader of the Catholic Church. He has no more right to tell us what to believe than you do. The Catholic Church has never said that there is only one correct answer to any question. The Church has always encouraged people to think for themselves and to search for truth. Catholics believe that the Bible contains the truth, but the Bible does not contain all the truth. Catholics also believe that God reveals truth through nature, reason, and human experience. Catholics believe that the Catholic Church is part of God's plan for humanity. But Catholics also believe that the Catholic Church is not infallible (meaning that it can make mistakes). Catholics believe that the Catholic Church is a witness to Jesus Christ and to the truths of the Christian faith. Catholics believe that the Catholic Church is not an end in itself, but rather is a means to an end. Catholics believe that the Catholic Church is a community of believers who are called to follow Jesus Christ.

    "response": "socialist system of government and economy is one where the state owns or controls the means of production and distribution of goods and services and where income is distributed based on need rather than work or profit. This system is often contrasted with capitalism, which is based on private ownership of the means of production and distribution of goods and services. The term \"socialist\" is also used to describe a political party that advocates for such a system. Socialist systems have been implemented in some countries, including China, Cuba, and Vietnam, but they are not always successful. Many socialists argue that a socialist system would be more just and equitable than a capitalist system, because it provides more economic security for everyone and prevents the wealthy from amassing too much power. Others argue that a socialist system is impractical and fails to provide enough incentives for people to work hard and produce goods and services. A socialist system can also lead to shortages of goods and services if there is not enough production to meet demand."

    "question": "is the human \" mind \" distinct from the brain ? Is the \" mind \" AKA cognition / personal identity purely derived from neurochemical reactions in the brain , or is there more to it ? Does mind = brain , or is the relationship more complex ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The Mind/Brain Question: Do We Have an Immortal Soul? Many people believe that our minds are separate from our bodies and have an existence beyond death. They believe that our minds are immortal and will continue to exist after we die. This belief in an immortal soul has been called \"the mind-body problem.\" The question of whether our minds are separate from our bodies is a long-standing philosophical debate. One group of philosophers believes that the mind exists independently of the body, while another group of philosophers believes that the mind is simply a product of the body. Philosophers who believe in an immortal soul have proposed two theories to explain the nature of the mind-body relationship. The first theory, which is also known as the dualist theory, states that the mind is a distinct entity that exists apart from the body. Dualists believe that the mind is a non-physical substance that exists independent of the physical world. Dualists argue that the mind can survive the destruction of the body. Dualists believe that the mind exists before birth and continues to exist after death. Dualists believe that the mind is not subject to the laws of physics and cannot be explained by science. The second theory, which is also known as the monist theory, states that the mind is identical to the body. Monists believe that the mind is a part of the body and cannot exist without the body. Monists believe that the mind is subject to the laws of physics and can be explained by science. Monists believe that the mind and the body are one and the same thing. Monists believe that the mind is not a separate entity but rather a part of the body. Monists believe that the mind can exist without the body. Monists believe that the mind dies with the body. The monist theory has gained support in recent years because of advances in neuroscience and cognitive psychology. Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system and its functions. Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of mental processes such as thinking, learning, and memory. Neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists use techniques such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and PET (positron emission tomography) scans to study the brain and the mind. These studies show that the mind is a function of the brain. The brain produces the mind. The mind does not exist independently of the brain. Therefore, the mind cannot survive the destruction of the brain. The mind is not a separate entity but rather a part of the body. The mind is the result of the body's functioning. The mind is not subject"

    "response": "When you have a new quarterback, the coach is going to give him the opportunity to play. If he plays well, then he will get more playing time. However, if he doesn't play well, then he won't get as much playing time. The coach also has to consider the other players on the team. He wants to make sure that everyone gets playing time. Sometimes, the coach will want to give a player who is not the best chance to play so that he can learn and improve. He may also want to make sure that the players who are already good don't lose their jobs. This means that the coach might keep a backup quarterback in the game even though he's not playing well. He might also keep a running back in the game even though he's not playing well. The coach might even decide to give a player with no chance of starting the game so that he can get experience. He may also decide to keep a player who isn't playing well because he needs the extra practice for the next game. Sometimes, the coach will wait to see how a player does before he decides what to do with him. He may want to wait until after the first or second game to see how the player does before deciding whether to give him more playing time. He may also want to wait until after the third or fourth game to see how the player does before making a decision. Sometimes, the coach will change his mind about which player should be playing. He may decide to switch the running back with the quarterback. He may also decide to switch the quarterback with the running back. The coach might even decide to use both players at once.

    "question": "if all subreddits are ( obviously ) part of reddit itself , why are they all \" /r / something ? \" is n't the \" r \" sort of a given ? surely the r does n't stand for anything else ... does it ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "(1) Reddit's history: Reddit was created in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian as an online community for discussing news and other topics. The site began with a single subreddit, r/news, and grew to over 100,000 subreddits as of October 2021. (2) The r in r/subreddit: The r in r/subreddit is short for Reddit. It's not a word in its own right. The r in r/subreddit doesn't mean anything. The r is just the first letter of the name of the site that contains the subreddit. The r is not part of the subreddit itself. (3) What's in a Name? Names can be confusing. In English, we have names like John Smith or Bill Clinton. We also have titles like Doctor, Professor, or Mr. In English, we use the title to describe the person's profession or status. For example, a doctor is a person who has a degree in medicine and practices medicine. A professor is a person who teaches at a college or university. A Mr. is a title used for a man. When you're talking about a place, the name might be different than the title. For example, the United States of America is called the U.S. or the US. The U.S. is short for United States of America. The US is short for United States. (4) Subreddits are not part of the Site: Each subreddit is its own site. A subreddit is a collection of posts on one topic. Each subreddit has its own rules. The r in r/subreddit is not part of the subreddit. The r is just the first letter of the name of the site that contains the subreddit. The r is not part of the subreddit."

    "question": "Q. Is there any way to get periods earlier than the due date?Hello doctor,I want to ask that is there any method with which we can have periods earlier than due date? Also, if we can use any tablet to delay monthly periods?",
    "response": "Yes, you can induce your period. If you want to try to get your period sooner than usual, you can take an oral contraceptive pill. This will stop ovulation and prevent pregnancy. It also causes the lining of the uterus to thin. The effect of this pill on your period depends on what kind you take. Some pills cause heavier bleeding while others cause lighter bleeding. You may be able to adjust your dosage to get the effect you want. However, if you do not already take the pill, you should talk to your doctor before starting it. Taking the pill can have side effects, including nausea, breast tenderness, headaches, and mood changes. Also, taking the pill does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You should always use a condom or another form of birth control along with the pill. You should not use the pill as a way to prevent pregnancy. Also, you should not take the pill if you have certain health problems, such as blood clots or cancer. Talk to your doctor about whether you can safely take the pill. You can also try to get your period sooner using other methods. These include: - Using estrogen cream or gel. These creams and gels are applied to the skin. They work in the same way as the pill. - Using progesterone cream or gel. This cream or gel is put on the vagina. It works by thickening the mucus around the cervix. This makes it harder for sperm to reach an egg. - Taking progesterone pills. These pills prevent ovulation. If you are trying to get your period sooner than usual, you should talk to your doctor first. He or she can help you decide which method might work best for you."

    "question": "If banks offer a fixed rate lower than the variable rate, is that an indication interest rates may head down?",
    "response": "The spread between fixed and variable rates of 3.1 percentage points was a record high for this time of year. The spread has narrowed in recent weeks as variable rates have declined. This is because the fixed rates are not tied to the prime rate and instead are based on the bank's cost of funds. This cost can be affected by many factors including changes in the money supply, inflation, and the bank's own balance sheet. It is also important to note that the spread between fixed and variable rates can vary depending on the type of loan and the term length. Fixed rates are often higher than variable rates for short-term loans due to the fact that the lender cannot adjust the rate if interest rates rise. However, fixed rates are often lower than variable rates for long-term loans because the lender can adjust the rate if interest rates rise. In conclusion, the spread between fixed and variable rates is not solely determined by the prime rate but rather by a variety of factors. It is important to consider all factors when deciding whether to take out a fixed or variable rate loan. It is also important to note that the spread between fixed and variable rates can vary depending on the type of loan and the term length.

    "question": "When shorting a stock, do you pay current market price or the best (lowest) available ask price?",
    "response": "Shorting is permitted for all types of investments except for options and futures. This means that you can short stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. However, you cannot short options and futures. You can only use your short positions to profit from a decline in the price of an investment. If the price goes up instead, you will incur a loss. You can also use your short positions to hedge against the risk of owning an asset. For example, if you own a stock and you expect its price to fall, you can short sell it to protect yourself from losses. However, you should be aware that short selling can be very risky and you can lose more money than you originally invested. That's why it's important to understand how to short sell before you start. If you're not sure about how to short sell, you can always hire a professional to do it for you. You can also learn how to short sell by following these steps: 1. First, decide which investment you want to short. 2. Then, choose a broker who allows short selling. 3. Next, place a short sale order with the broker. 4. Finally, wait for the investment to fall in price. When it does, you can close your short position and collect the difference between the price you sold the investment at and the price it fell to. This will give you a profit. If the investment rises in price instead, you will incur a loss. This is because you sold the investment at a higher price than you bought it at. However, you can still make money if you're able to buy back the investment at a lower price than you sold it at. This is called covering your short position. This is why it's important to know how to short sell and how to cover your short position. The most important thing to remember is that short selling is risky and you can lose more money than you originally invested.

    "question": "Why do radio stations play the same songs everyday , multiple times ? IT 'S DRIVING ME INSANE ! THE MALL BUILDING I WORK IN HAS THE RADIO ON AND IT 'S THE SAME STUPID SONGS ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The reason is simple: It's cheaper to play the same songs over and over again than to pay for new music. Also, most of the radio stations that play the same songs over and over again have very small budgets, so they can't afford to buy lots of CDs or other types of music. So, they play the same songs over and over again. This is why you hear the same song 10 or more times in one hour on some stations. Sometimes, if the station has a lot of money, they may be able to play lots of different songs. But, it still costs them money to play the songs. So, even if they play lots of different songs, they're still spending money on music. If they don't play enough songs, they'll run out of music to play. The good news is that there are many, many, many different kinds of music available for radio stations to play. So, even if your local radio station plays the same songs over and over again, there's still lots of music to listen to on other stations."

    "question": "Why does my dog spin around 3 times before she lays down ? I have seen a lot of dogs do this and would like to know why so many of them seem to be programmed this way Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Spinning around three times before laying down is called \"circling.\" Circling is a behavior that's often seen in dogs who sleep on soft surfaces such as blankets, pillows, or beds. Circling may also occur in dogs who sleep in a tight corner between two pieces of furniture. Some dogs even circle on the floor right next to their owners! The reason for circling is unknown. It might be related to the way a dog senses its surroundings. Some people believe that circling is a sign of good health. Other people think that circling is a sign of an illness. Circling can be a normal behavior or a symptom of a problem. If you're concerned about your dog's circling, talk to your veterinarian. He or she can help you decide whether to watch your dog closely for changes in behavior or to take your dog to the veterinarian. If your dog's circling is related to a medical problem, treatment will depend on the cause of the problem. If your dog's circling is not related to a medical problem, you may want to consider whether your dog has a comfortable place to sleep. Dogs with a favorite spot to sleep are more likely to develop good sleep habits. If your dog is circling because he or she likes to sleep in a certain spot, you may want to try moving the dog's sleeping area to another part of the house. If the dog doesn't move, you can use a crate or kennel to contain him or her in the new sleeping area. If you find that your dog circles only in certain places, you can try placing the dog in those areas when it's time for bed.

    "question": "can someone explain how sports betting works ? What is a spread ? Moneyline ? Total ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Sports Betting Explained For the first time ever, the NCAA has released a list of schools that have been granted permission to accept wagers on their games. The NCAA's decision to allow this is a significant shift in the world of college sports betting. The decision came after the organization received a petition from the American Gaming Association (AGA) which requested that the NCAA allow its member schools to accept wagers on their games. The NCAA has now granted permission to 120 schools to accept wagers on their games. This is a major step forward for college sports betting and it will likely lead to more schools granting permission to accept wagers on their games in the future. It will also help to increase the amount of money being wagered on college sports. It will also make it easier for fans to bet on their favorite teams. In the past, fans would have had to go through a third party to place a bet on their favorite team. Now they can simply go to the school's website or mobile app and place a bet on their favorite team. This will also make it easier for the school to collect revenue from the bets placed on their games. It will also make it easier for the school to track the amount of money being wagered on their games. It will also make it easier for the school to share the information with other schools. This will also help to create a more level playing field for all schools when it comes to accepting wagers on their games.

My blood pressure usually is around 110/80 with my pulse around 88. But at my last dr. app I was 150/94 with my pulse at 104. I am a cancer survivor. I have undergone multiple surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation . Wondering if I should see my provider? Or am I being a worry wart .",
    "response": "The swelling of the right leg could be related to the cancer or the treatments you received for it. It could also be due to a condition called lymphedema. This is a common complication of breast cancer surgery. Lymphedema occurs when lymph fluid builds up in the tissues of the affected limb. The swelling can occur in one or both arms or legs. Sometimes the swelling occurs in the hands or feet. Swelling may be present all the time or only after certain activities, such as walking. Other symptoms include heaviness, soreness, warmth, redness, and pain. If you think you have lymphedema, you should see your doctor. He or she may refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in treating lymphedema. Treatment for this condition includes manual lymph drainage (MLD), which is done by trained therapists. The goal of MLD is to stimulate the movement of lymph fluid away from the affected area. You may also need to wear compression stockings to help prevent further swelling. The compression stockings should fit well and be worn during the day. If the swelling is severe, you may need to wear them night and day. The swelling may go away when the treatment is finished. However, it may come back if you stop wearing the compression stockings. The swelling may get worse if you do not follow your doctor's advice about the treatment and lifestyle changes. For more information about lymphedema, go to the National Cancer Institute's Health Topics Web page on this condition. You should also ask your doctor about the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen. These drugs may help reduce swelling. If you have any questions about these suggestions, talk to your doctor. You should not take any of these medications without first talking to him or her. Your doctor will want to make sure that they are safe for you to take."

    "response": "The process of bringing a prisoner to execution can be lengthy and complicated. This picture shows a man who has been on death row for 16 years. It took him that long to get to the point where he was sentenced to die. He had been convicted of murder in 1994, but his case was repeatedly delayed due to appeals. He was finally executed in 2010. In this case, the death penalty was not carried out because the person was too ill to face the execution. Many other prisoners have spent years or even decades on death row before their cases were decided. The time spent on death row depends on many factors, including whether the prisoner's appeal goes to the state or federal court system. A prisoner's appeal can last years, and there are multiple appeals. The prisoner may also spend time in prison while waiting for the appeal to be heard. The time spent on death row can be as little as a few months, or as long as several decades. Some states have abolished the death penalty, and others have put limits on how long a prisoner can spend on death row."

They have to be able to read the crowd, so they can see if they are dancing or not. Some artists will also do special things like light shows, fireworks, and even costumes. The artists will also play different songs throughout the night. They'll usually start off with some of their more popular songs, but then they'll move on to new songs. Some artists even play their own original music. DJs and producers play music through speakers at live shows. DJs will use a variety of sounds and effects to create different styles of music. DJs will also mix tracks together to create a new song. DJs will often perform with other musicians, who will play instruments. DJs and producers work in studios to record and mix music.

    "question": "Please explain what is \"Quantum mechanics\"",
    "response": "Quantum Mechanics. A quantum mechanical system is described by a wave function. The wave function is a mathematical description of the probability of finding a particle at any given point in space. The wave function is complex-valued and its modulus squared gives the probability density for the particle being found at a particular position. In other words, the wave function contains information about where the particle is likely to be found. The wave function must satisfy certain equations called Schrodinger's equations. The wave function may be represented as a superposition of energy eigenstates. Energy eigenstates are solutions to the Schrodinger equation that have definite energies. A particle may be described as being in a superposition of energy eigenstates. This means that it has a certain energy but its exact value cannot be known with certainty. The exact energy can only be known within a range of values. In quantum mechanics, particles do not have well-defined positions and velocities until they are measured. The act of measurement causes the wave function to collapse to one of the possible energy eigenstates. The particle then has an exact energy and a well-defined position and velocity. In some cases, the wave function may be able to describe the behavior of a particle without any measurements being made. This is called a pure state. However, if the particle is observed, its wave function will collapse. Pure states may be represented as a single energy eigenstate or as a superposition of energy eigenstates. In the case of a superposition of energy eigenstates, the particle will have a definite energy but its exact value cannot be known with certainty. If the particle is observed, its wave function will collapse to one of the possible energy eigenstates. The particle will then have an exact energy and a well-defined position and velocity. In other cases, the wave function may not be able to describe the behavior of a particle without any measurements being made. This is called a mixed state. In a mixed state, the particle may be in a superposition of energy eigenstates but its exact energy cannot be known. The particle may also be in a pure state. However, if the particle is observed, its wave function will collapse to one of the possible energy eigenstates. The particle will then have an exact energy and a well-defined position and velocity. Mixed states may be represented as a mixture of pure states. In a mixed state, the particle may be in a superposition of energy eigenstates but its exact energy cannot be known.

    "question": "Manual Cars Literally just explain what the clutch does to let the car change gear . And like how the gears move in and shit . Just explain a manual engine like I 'm 5 Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Manual cars have a clutch, which allows you to shift gears without having to stop the car. When the clutch is engaged, the transmission shafts and the engine are connected so that the engine can turn the wheels of the car. When the clutch is disengaged, the engine and the wheels are not connected. This lets you shift from one gear to another. The clutch also helps prevent damage to the transmission if you try to shift gears while the car is moving. The clutch is controlled by a lever or pedal. If you want to shift to a lower gear (a higher number), you press the clutch pedal down. This disengages the clutch, so the transmission shafts and the engine are not connected. Then, you put the car into the lower gear. Next, you use the brake to slow down the car. As you slow down, you lift the clutch pedal up. This engages the clutch, so the transmission shafts and the engine are connected. Then, you slowly release the brake pedal and let the car speed up. This lets the engine turn the wheels. Now, you can shift to a higher gear (a lower number). You repeat this process as you shift through the gears. The clutch has a metal disc called a \"pulley.\" This pulley is attached to the clutch. It turns when you press the clutch pedal. The clutch connects the pulley to the transmission shafts. This allows the engine to turn the wheels. The clutch also has a metal ring called a \"pinion.\" This pinion is attached to the transmission shafts. It turns when you shift gears. The clutch connects the pinion to the pulley. This lets the engine turn the transmission shafts. The clutch also has a metal hub called a \"drum.\" This drum is attached to the transmission shafts. It turns when you shift gears.

The zenzedi is what will with me except for the painful tongue.  Please help.",
    "response": "The term \"fissured tongue\" refers to the appearance of cracks or ridges on the surface of the tongue. These cracks and ridges may be present in various locations on the tongue, including the tip, sides, and back of the tongue. The cracks can be deep or shallow, narrow or wide, and may run in a single direction or crisscross. Some people may have only a few small cracks, while others may have many long cracks that appear to run the length of the tongue. A fissured tongue is usually painless, but in some cases, the cracks can become irritated and cause discomfort or pain when chewing, swallowing, or eating hot foods. In rare cases, fissures on the tongue can erode to form sores (ulcers). These ulcers can be painful and may take several weeks to heal. The cause of fissured tongue is unknown. It may occur as part of an underlying medical condition or it may occur without any known cause. Fissured tongue may be more common in older adults, but it can also occur in younger people. Fissured tongue has been associated with certain medications, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and drugs used to treat high blood pressure. People who have undergone radiation therapy to the head and neck area may also develop fissured tongue. Other factors that may increase your risk of developing fissured tongue include: Smoking Alcoholism Diabetes Malnutrition Vitamin B12 deficiency Certain viruses, such as HIV/AIDS and Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (the virus that causes cold sores) Certain bacteria, such as Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, which are normally found in the mouth High stress levels Recent dental procedures, such as tooth extractions or crowns Recent surgery or trauma to the tongue, such as burns, ulcers, or cuts To date, no treatment has been proven effective for the prevention or cure of fissured tongue. If you are experiencing discomfort due to fissured tongue, talk to your doctor or dentist about possible treatments. The use of topical corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory medications may help reduce the symptoms of fissured tongue.

    "response": "The water molecule is very small and has a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end. When water freezes it becomes ice and the molecules arrange themselves into a hexagonal structure with six sides. The positive end of one molecule is attracted to the negative end of the next molecule. This arrangement is called a \"hexagonal\" structure. The reason for this is that the two charges on each molecule attract each other. The two charges on each molecule attract each other because they have opposite charges. So if you take the water molecule and put its positive end on the left side and its negative end on the right side, then the next water molecule will have its positive end on the right side and its negative end on the left side. If you keep doing this, the water molecules will form a hexagon shape. This is why a snowflake is shaped like a hexagon. The hexagon shape is formed by the way the water molecules are arranged. The hexagon shape is not determined by the fact that the water molecules are arranged in a certain order. The hexagon shape is a property of the water molecule itself.

    "question": "Historically , does socialism work long - term ? Why or why not ? Citing historical examples , not hypothetical , does a socialistic system of government really work in practice over the long term ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Socialism is a form of economic system where production and distribution of goods are carried out under collective ownership of the means of production and where all profits are shared by the workers. The workers share their earnings in order to support themselves and their families. In this way, the wealth of society is distributed more equally among all members of the society. This is in contrast to a capitalist system, where the means of production are owned privately and where the profits from production are kept by the owners. In capitalism, the workers have no control over the means of production and must sell their labor power to the owners in order to earn wages and survive. In socialism, the workers own the means of production and do not need to sell their labor power to the owners in order to survive. In socialism, the workers can use their earnings to support themselves and their families and can also use them to improve their living standards and quality of life. The workers also have a say in how the economy is run. They can vote on important decisions about the economy and can participate in the decision-making process. This helps to ensure that the economy works for the benefit of all members of the society. In socialism, the workers also have a say in how the economy is run.

    "response": "The 25th of December is the day on which the Christian Church celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. This day has been celebrated as a religious festival for over 1,000 years. The exact date of Jesus' birth is not known but it is thought to have taken place in the late autumn or winter. Christians celebrate Christmas to remember the birth of Jesus Christ and the event of his crucifixion and resurrection. Other religions and cultures also celebrate the 25th of December. For example, some Jews celebrate Hanukkah (which means \"dedication\" in Hebrew) at this time. It celebrates the rededication of the temple in Jerusalem. Some Pagans celebrate the Winter Solstice on the 25th of December. The Winter Solstice marks the shortest day of the year and is thought to be the time when the sun begins to move back towards the North Pole. The word \"Solstice\" comes from the Latin word \"solstitium\" which means \"sun stands still\". Many people believe that the ancient Romans celebrated Saturnalia at this time of the year. Saturnalia was a week-long festival in honour of Saturn, the Roman god of agriculture. The Romans believed that Saturn was the king of gods. He gave gifts to the people and they celebrated by giving gifts to one another. In the early days of Christianity, the 25th of December was not widely celebrated. However, in the fourth century AD the Christian Church decided to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ on the same day as the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. They chose this date because it was already a well-known date among Christians. It is thought that the first Christians were very poor and did not have enough money to celebrate their festival with food and drink. As a result, the church decided to use the date of the Roman festival of Saturnalia instead. They chose this date because it was already a well-known date among Christians.

    "question": "Buying my first car: why financing is cheaper than paying cash here and now?",
    "response": ". When you buy your first home, the mortgage, or youll have to pay interest on the loan for a longer period of time. This can cost you thousands of dollars in interest payments over the life of the loan. For example, if you take out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 4 percent, your monthly payment will be $1,200. If you pay it off in 15 years instead, your monthly payment will be $1,800. That means youll pay $1,200 less in total interest over the life of the loan. However, youll also pay more in interest each month. This can make your monthly payment higher. You should also consider that the lower interest rate may mean that you qualify for a larger loan amount. This could give you more money to use for closing costs, repairs, and furnishings. The lower interest rate may also mean that you can afford to put more money down on the house. This could help you avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI). Mortgage lenders often require PMI if you put less than 20 percent down on the house. You can find out how much PMI you would need to pay by using a mortgage calculator.

    "response": "There is no way to know for sure why astronauts stopped going to the moon in 1972. It was a decision made by the U.S. government and it had nothing to do with the quality of the space program or the safety of the astronauts. In fact, the space program continued to be very successful after 1972. Astronauts flew to the moon again in 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. After that, the United States stopped sending astronauts to the moon. The Soviet Union, however, kept flying people to the moon until 1981. After that, the Soviet Union also stopped sending people to the moon. For many years, the United States did not send any people to space at all. But in 1981, the first space shuttle took off. Space shuttles have flown every year since then. They fly to the International Space Station, which is the largest structure ever built in space. Space shuttles have also flown to the Hubble Space Telescope and other satellites in orbit. Space shuttles have also flown to the moon, though not for many years. Today, the United States is planning to send people back to the moon."

    "response": "Your abdominal pain may be due to fatty liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver (scarring of the liver). Cirrhosis of the liver is a serious condition that can cause severe complications, including liver failure and liver cancer. Cirrhosis can also lead to other health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. If you have fatty liver disease, your doctor will want to find out whether you have cirrhosis. He or she may recommend an ultrasound test. An ultrasound test uses sound waves to create pictures of the liver on a computer screen. The pictures show whether there is scarring in the liver and how much of the liver has been damaged. A liver biopsy also can help diagnose fatty liver disease and determine the extent of any liver damage. This procedure involves taking a small piece of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. A liver biopsy can provide information about whether you have cirrhosis and how much of the liver is damaged. Your doctor may recommend that you have a liver biopsy if he or she thinks you have cirrhosis but doesn't know it. Or your doctor may recommend a biopsy to check for cirrhosis before prescribing certain medicines. For example, he or she may prescribe a medicine called thiamazole (Thyrozole) to treat thyroid problems. But this medicine can damage the liver. Your doctor may want to check for cirrhosis before prescribing thiamazole to make sure that the medicine won't harm your liver. Your doctor may also recommend a liver biopsy if you're being treated for hepatitis B or C. Liver Biopsy Procedure A liver biopsy is usually done in a hospital or outpatient center. The procedure takes about 15 to 30 minutes. You'll be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will give you medicine to relax you. The doctor may use local anesthesia to numb the area where the biopsy will be done. He or she may give you medicine to relax you before the procedure. If you're going to have a liver biopsy done, talk to your doctor about the risks and possible complications of the procedure. Some people have bleeding or bruising at the site of the biopsy. Rarely, people have more serious complications, such as: - Bleeding into the abdomen. - Damage to the bile ducts. - Infection. - Pneumothorax (collapsed lung). - Severe allergic reaction to the medicine used during the procedure. Your doctor may recommend a different type of biopsy if you're at high risk for these complications. For example"

    "response": "The percentage of the damage dealt is determined by the formula that uses the percentage of the maximum health of the target and the percentage of the maximum health of the attacker.

It also helps to balance the damage dealt if the target has high health and the attacker has low health. This way, the damage dealt is more consistent and fair."

    "response": "Let's say that Country A owes Country B $100 billion in loans. Country A can pay back the loan by sending Country B $100 billion in cash. Or, Country A could send Country B a check that says, \"Pay this amount to Country B.\" Or, Country A could send Country B an electronic payment, which is just a computerized version of a check. In all cases, Country A is paying back the loan to Country B."

    "question": "liquor store caught fire , why is everything thrown out ? I realise that groceries and that sorta thing gets contaminated , but why is alcoholic beverages and Liquor is thrown out aswell , even though some of it was nt close to the fire ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The alcohol in liquor can catch fire and explode if exposed to heat or flames. When a fire occurs in a liquor store, all of the alcohol in the store must be removed to prevent the possibility of an explosion. The alcohol is then disposed of in a safe manner. Alcohol from damaged bottles can also cause fires. It's important to dispose of damaged bottles properly. Damaged bottles should be sealed in plastic bags, placed in a sturdy cardboard box, and then sent to a hazardous waste facility for disposal. The boxes containing the bottles should be marked \"Hazardous Waste\" or \"Flammable Liquids.\" For more information about hazardous waste facilities in your area, contact your local government or visit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website at http://www.epa.gov/. If you have any questions about how to dispose of damaged liquor bottles, contact your local fire department or hazardous waste facility. You may also call 1-800-273-TALK (8255). This number is a free and confidential service that connects people with their local health and human services agencies. You may also call 1-800-427-2827. This is the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Helpline. This service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It's free and confidential. You can use this service to find treatment centers near you. You may also call 911 if you need help right away. Firefighters will respond to your call and remove the alcohol from the store. The alcohol will be disposed of safely and will not explode."

    "question": "Why does n’t pointing a camera at the sun directly damage it , like our eyes get damaged ? I know we ’re living things and cellular components are different from electrical components , but what is it about cameras that prevents the damage ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The lens of the camera has a very special coating which makes it less sensitive to light than the human eye. This is why you can look through the viewfinder of your camera without any harm being done to your retina. The coating on the lens also protects the lens from dust and other debris. The sensor in a digital camera is much more sensitive to light than the human retina. It's made up of millions of tiny light-sensitive diodes called pixels. These pixels are very small and have a very small surface area. So even though they're very sensitive to light, they're not as sensitive as the human retina. If the camera's sensor were as sensitive to light as the human retina, it would be possible to damage the sensor if you pointed it directly at the sun. Even if the sensor were not damaged, it could overheat. To protect the sensor, most digital cameras use an anti-reflective coating on their sensors. This coating reduces the amount of light reflected off the sensor and keeps the sensor cooler. The camera will automatically turn off if it overheats. Some high-end cameras have an infrared filter in front of the sensor. This filter blocks some of the infrared radiation coming from the sun. Infrared radiation is a type of light that's invisible to the human eye. The infrared filter helps prevent the sensor from overheating."

    "question": "Are dividends the only thing linking stocks to corporate performance?",
    "response": "Dividends are the main source of income for shareholders. The company's financial performance is often reflected in the dividend payout ratio. A higher payout ratio means that more of the company's earnings are being returned to shareholders through dividends. This can be an indication that the company is confident about its future prospects and willing to share its profits with its shareholders. On the other hand, if the payout ratio is lower than usual, it may indicate that the company is using its earnings to reinvest in its business or pay down debt. This can be a sign that the company is focused on long-term growth rather than short-term profits. However, it is important to note that not all companies that have high payout ratios are necessarily good investments. It is always a good idea to do your own research and consider a variety of factors before making any investment decisions."

    "question": "What are the chances of pregnany post intercourse without penetration?Hi my name is Tiffany and I had unprotected sex twice with 2 different guys one on the 4 and the other on 11 but none of them nutted in me they both pulled out so the question is there a possibility that I can still get pregnant cause my calendar says I'm 4 days late but I always had a irregular menstrual",
    "response": "It is possible to become pregnant after unprotected sex if the penis comes into contact with the vagina or cervix (the opening to the uterus). This can happen even if no ejaculation occurred. Ejaculation does not have to occur inside the vagina to result in pregnancy. Sperm can be released from the penis outside the vagina and still reach the uterus and cause pregnancy. Sperm can also move from the vagina through the cervix and into the uterus. Sperm can survive in the uterus for up to five days, which means that it may be able to fertilize an egg that has been released from the ovary. The chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex depends on many factors, including: - Whether the woman is ovulating (has just released an egg from her ovary) or not. If she is ovulating, she is more likely to become pregnant than if she is not ovulating. - Whether she has been taking any hormonal birth control pills or other hormonal drugs. Hormonal drugs can affect a woman's ability to get pregnant. - How long it has been since the last time she had unprotected sex. The longer the time between sexual acts, the greater the chance that she will get pregnant. - Whether she has already had unprotected sex with another man. If she has, the sperm from that act could already be inside her body and waiting to fertilize an egg. - Whether she has taken any drugs that might affect her ability to get pregnant. Drugs that might affect her fertility include some antibiotics, anti-seizure medications, chemotherapy drugs, and certain antidepressants. If you think you may be pregnant, take a home pregnancy test as soon as possible. A negative result means that you are not pregnant. A positive result means that you are pregnant. If your test is negative but you still think you may be pregnant, take the test again a few days later. If you are still not sure, see your doctor for further testing. If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor about what to expect during your pregnancy and how to care for yourself and your baby."

    "response": "The reason for this is that the carbon dioxide in the soda is making your eyes water. Carbon dioxide is a gas and it's very hard to breathe in. Your eyes have a special tear gland which produces tears to help you breathe in the carbon dioxide. So when you take a drink of soda, you're breathing in the carbon dioxide, so your eyes make lots of tears.

    "response": "you're not on a race track: The redline is an advisory limit of maximum RPM (revolutions per minute) that the engine can safely reach. If you push past this limit, the engine will overheat. Overheating means the oil becomes too hot to work properly. The oil can't lubricate or cool the moving parts as well. If the oil overheats, it may break down, causing it to lose its ability to lubricate and cool the engine. The result is that the moving parts can get so hot they'll burn up. If you push past the redline while driving in stop-and-go traffic, the engine may not overheat, but it's still not a good idea. If you push past the redline on a race track, the engine will definitely overheat. That's because the engine is working hard and generating lots of heat. Pushing past the redline can also damage the engine. This can be very expensive to fix. If you push past the redline in a stick shift, you can hurt yourself. If you have a manual transmission, the clutch pedal is the key to shifting gears. If you push past the redline while the clutch is depressed, you could hurt yourself. In a manual transmission, the clutch pedal is the key to shifting gears. If you push past the redline while the clutch is depressed, you could hurt yourself. When you depress the clutch pedal, the clutch disengages the transmission from the engine. The engine turns at a different speed than the transmission. When you release the clutch pedal, the clutch engages the transmission with the engine. The engine and transmission turn at the same speed. The engine must turn faster than the transmission to keep up. As you accelerate, the engine has to turn faster and faster to keep up with the transmission. This means the engine is working harder. It generates more heat. If you push past the redline while the clutch is depressed, the engine will overheat. The engine can't generate enough power to shift gears. The transmission can't shift gears fast enough to keep up with the engine. The transmission will slip out of gear. The vehicle will lurch forward, then lurch backward.

    "question": "How a currency can just be invented ? Ex : Bitcoin How do you just invent a currency , and who \" started \" bitcoin ? Who gave it value . It just seems ridiculous to me . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "the time when we had no money, people bartered with goods. A man with food would trade with another man for meat, and so on. In this way, people were able to get what they needed. When money came along, it was used as a medium of exchange. A man with food could now pay for meat with money instead of trading goods directly with someone else. This made things much easier and allowed more trade to take place. As money became more widely accepted, people began to use it for other purposes too. It was used to pay for loans and taxes, to settle debts, and even to buy land. Over time, money took many forms. It was first used in the form of coins made from precious metals such as gold and silver. Later, paper money was introduced. Paper money was backed by the government's promise to give the holder gold or silver coins. This system worked well until the 19th century. At that time, governments began to print paper money without backing it by gold or silver coins. Instead, the value of the money was based on the economy's wealth. If the economy grew and produced more goods, then the value of the money increased. If the economy shrunk, the value of the money would fall. The idea that the value of money was based on the economy's wealth led to the creation of paper money called fiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value. Its value is based on its acceptance in the economy. Fiat money is also called \"fiat\" because the government says that it has value. Fiat money was used in the United States starting in 1861. Today, most money in the world is fiat money."

    "response": "It's not as if there is an off/on switch for emotions . There is no way to turn off emotions. We can't control when we feel happy, sad, angry, or any other emotion. But we can learn to understand and express our emotions in ways that don't harm ourselves or others. We can also learn how to talk with our doctors about our feelings so they can help us. If you're feeling sad or angry, you might want to talk about it with someone you trust. Maybe you have a parent, friend, or teacher who can listen without judging you. Or maybe you can write about your feelings in a journal. Sometimes talking with a counselor or therapist can help you understand your emotions better.

    "question": "Why do people like to listen to bass ? Why is it the only thing many people care about when listening to music ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Low frequency sound that you can feel. Many of the sounds we hear have a very low pitch, but we can't always feel them. The lowest sounds you can feel are called subsonic frequencies. You can feel subsonic frequencies in your chest and abdomen. If you feel them, you may not be able to hear them at all. You can also feel subsonic frequencies in your feet. When you walk around, you may feel vibrations under your feet. This is because your feet are resting on the ground, which is vibrating. The ground is vibrating because the Earth is constantly moving up and down. You can feel this vibration in your feet, but you can't hear it. It's a good idea to wear shoes when you walk around. This will protect your feet from any sharp or rough vibrations. The Earth moves up and down every 24 hours. This movement causes the ground to vibrate. The vibration makes your feet feel warm and comfortable. This is why you can feel subsonic frequencies in your feet. You can also feel subsonic frequencies in your chest and abdomen.

    "question": "How are the US still allowed to use drone strikes when the civilian casualty rate is so high ? Just seems that if it was anyone else , people would make a bigger deal . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The United States has used drones to carry out military operations in at least 28 countries and territories since 2001. There have been more than 1,000 confirmed civilian deaths in these operations. While the US government says the vast majority of the casualties are \"combatants,\" there is no independent verification of this claim. The US also claims that its use of drones in Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, and elsewhere is justified because it is targeting \"terrorist\" leaders. However, there is little evidence that any of the people killed were terrorists. In fact, the US government has admitted that many of the people killed in its drone strikes have not been involved in terrorist activities. The US also admits that its drone attacks have killed many innocent civilians. It is difficult to know how many people have been killed in US drone strikes, but the US government has released information about some of them. For example, in 2013, the US State Department released a list of 16 people who had been killed in US drone strikes in Pakistan. The US government said that these people were \"terrorists\" and had been killed by mistake. However, it did not provide any evidence to support this claim. In 2015, the US government admitted that many of the people killed in its drone attacks in Somalia were not involved in terrorism. The US government said that it had killed many innocent civilians. However, it did not provide any evidence to support this claim. In 2017, the US government admitted that many of the people killed in its drone attacks in Yemen were not involved in terrorism. The US government said that it had killed many innocent civilians. However, it did not provide any evidence to support this claim. In 2019, the US government admitted that many of the people killed in its drone attacks in Afghanistan were not involved in terrorism. The US government said that it had killed many innocent civilians. However, it did not provide any evidence to support this claim. The US government has also admitted that many of the people killed in its drone attacks in Iraq were not involved in terrorism. The US government said that it had killed many innocent civilians. However, it did not provide any evidence to support this claim. The US government has also admitted that many of the people killed in its drone attacks in Libya were not involved in terrorism.

    "response": "It's not possible to know exactly when someone dies unless they tell you or you see them die. If you watch the shows closely, you'll see that the people in the lab sometimes have to make guesses about when the body was killed or died. They look at the body for signs of life before death. They look at the body for signs of movement after death. They look at the body for signs of decay. They look at the body for signs of injury. They look at the body for signs of what kind of death it was (accident, murder, etc.). The people in the lab don't just guess. They look at all the clues they can find and use their training to figure out the best answer. Sometimes they're right and sometimes they're wrong. It's not always possible to tell the exact time of death. Sometimes the body is so badly damaged that the people in the lab can't tell much about it. Sometimes there aren't any clues about what happened. Sometimes they get the information from a witness or someone else who saw the person die. Sometimes they get the information from the police. Sometimes they get the information from a crime scene technician. Sometimes they get the information from a victim's family. Sometimes they get the information from a coroner.

    "question": "when was the internet started",
    "response": ", the Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks that use the TCP/IP protocols to transmit data and information between computers and other devices such as televisions and smartphones. The Internet uses a series of protocols (TCP/IP) to transmit data and information between computers. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which is a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted over the internet. TCP/IP allows different devices to communicate with each other, regardless of their operating systems or hardware. This makes it possible for people to access the internet from anywhere in the world, as long as they have an internet connection and a device to connect to it. TCP/IP also ensures that data is transmitted accurately and efficiently, so that users can access the information they need quickly and easily. TCP/IP is made up of two parts: - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): This protocol ensures that data is transmitted in a reliable and consistent manner. It also provides error detection and correction, so that data is not lost or corrupted during transmission. - Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is responsible for routing data packets across the network. It determines the best path for data to take, based on factors such as traffic levels and network congestion. TCP/IP is used by all major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Opera. These browsers use TCP/IP to connect to web servers and retrieve web pages, images, videos, and other content. They also use TCP/IP to send user input, such as text and form submissions, back to the web server. In addition to web browsing, TCP/IP is used by email clients, file transfer protocols (FTP), and other applications that require internet connectivity. For example, you can use FTP to upload files to a web server, or to download files from a remote location. You can also use FTP to transfer files between computers on the same local area network (LAN). FTP uses TCP/IP to establish a secure connection between your computer and the web server. This connection is known as a \"session\" and it lasts until you close the session. During the session, you can send and receive files using TCP/IP. FTP is often used by developers and IT professionals to transfer files between computers and to test websites and applications. You can also use FTP to transfer files between computers on the same local area network (LAN). FTP uses TCP/IP to establish a secure connection between your computer and the web server.

    "question": "Why are sex offenders released into the public if it 's determined that they 're highly likely to reoffend ? Is it just a matter of \" you served your time so there 's nothing we can do ? \" I 'm a Canadian , by the way . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The answer is yes, but it's not because you served your time and there's nothing we can do. The reason for this is because in Canada, when someone is convicted of a crime, the judge has the authority to determine the sentence he or she will be given. If the judge feels that a person is at high risk of reoffending, he or she may recommend that the person be placed on probation instead of serving time in jail. Probation allows the person to continue living in the community under the supervision of a probation officer. Probation officers help people who have been convicted of crimes to get back on their feet and reintegrate into society. Probation officers also monitor the person to make sure that he or she follows the conditions of the probation. If a person violates the terms of his or her probation, he or she may be sent to jail. People who have been convicted of crimes must always abide by the laws of the country. They cannot change the law, but they can't break the law either. If a person violates the law after being released from jail, he or she can be sent back to prison. People who have been convicted of crimes are required to pay restitution, which means that they must pay money to the victims of their crime. This can include paying medical bills, repairing damage to property, or helping to replace lost or stolen goods. If a person refuses to pay restitution, the court can take action against him or her, including taking away his or her driver's license. People who have been convicted of crimes must also register with the police if they move to a new address. This helps the police keep track of them and makes sure that they don't try to avoid the consequences of their actions.

    "response": "Well, it's not quite true that a line has no volume because it's made up of points. It's true that a point has no volume. However, a line is a collection of points. A line segment is a collection of points with a definite length. A plane is a collection of lines. A solid object is a collection of planes. A sphere is a collection of points in space with a definite radius. The volume of an object is defined as the amount of space occupied by the object. A point occupies no space at all, so its volume is zero. A line segment has a finite length but occupies no space, so its volume is zero. A plane has a finite area but occupies no space, so its volume is zero. A solid object has a finite volume but occupies no space, so its volume is finite. A sphere has a finite volume but occupies no space, so its volume is finite. The volume of an object is finite because it occupies some space, even though it's made up of points that have no volume.

    "question": "Why are magnetic stripes still on credit / debit cards in the UK ? I 'm in the UK so every single shop i 've been to accepts Chip & Pin , why does my debit card still have a magnetic strip ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Magnetic stripe credit cards were first introduced in 1960 and became common place in the 1970s. They were used because of the lack of computer technology at the time. They work by using the magnetic strip to store the information needed to complete a transaction. It is possible to create fake cards with a magnetic stripe if they are not protected by a chip. This makes them easy to use for fraud. There are several ways that a magnetic stripe can be protected. One way is to put a chip into the card. This chip contains the information that the magnetic stripe used to contain. The chip also has its own unique identification number. If a chip is placed in a card, it is then safe from fraud. Another way to protect a card is to use a hologram. A hologram is a special type of picture that can only be seen when light shines on it. This is done by putting a special coating over the magnetic stripe. When light shines on the card, the hologram appears. This makes the card hard to copy. In addition to these methods, there are other ways to protect your card from fraud. These include using a PIN (personal identification number) to verify that you are the one who is trying to make the transaction. This is called Chip & PIN. It also includes using a signature to verify that you are the one who is trying to make the transaction. This is called Chip & Sign. If you use a card that is protected by a chip, it will have the words \"EMV\" printed on it. This stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa. These three companies developed the chip technology. This means that the card is protected against fraud."

    "question": "What is pi and why does it work ? Simple question , but i guess the answer is n't going to be as simple . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Pi is a constant ratio between a circles circumference and its diameter. The formula for finding the area of a circle is A = r 2. The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2 r. The value of pi is approximately 3.14. The number pi is an irrational number. This means that the digits after the decimal never repeat in a pattern. The digits after the decimal point go on forever without repeating. The value of pi has been calculated to over 1 trillion digits past the decimal point. It was first calculated by Archimedes of Syracuse in 250 B. C. He used polygons with many sides to approximate the area of a circle. He then used these approximations to calculate the value of pi. The value of pi was further approximated by Ludolph van Ceulen in the 16th century. He calculated the first 36 digits of pi. The digits were engraved on his tombstone. The number pi has also been calculated using supercomputers. The most accurate value of pi known to date was calculated in 2009 by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo. They calculated pi to over 10 trillion digits. The digits of pi have been used to test computer performance. Pi has also been used to estimate the amount of time it will take a computer to perform certain calculations. The digits of pi have been used to estimate the amount of time it will take a computer to perform certain calculations. The digits of pi have also been used to test computer hardware.

    "response": "It is not clear why some people deny climate change. We know that many people have a hard time believing that the Earth's climate is changing. There are many things in our lives that we don't fully understand, and climate change is one of them. It takes time to learn about new scientific information. Also, it is normal to want to believe what you think is right. People who believe in climate change may be concerned about how it will affect their children and grandchildren. Some people may be afraid of what will happen if climate change becomes worse. Others may be worried that climate change will make it harder for them to make money. Still others may be upset by the idea that humans are causing climate change. Sometimes people who deny climate change may also deny other scientific ideas. For example, they may not believe that smoking causes cancer or that vaccines cause autism. People who deny climate change may believe that scientists are not telling the truth. They may think that scientists are hiding information that they don't want people to know. Sometimes people who deny climate change may be trying to protect their own interests. For example, they may work for oil companies or other industries that could be hurt if climate change becomes worse. It is important to remember that people who deny climate change are not necessarily wrong. It takes time to learn about new scientific information.

    "question": "What are the advantages of a Swiss bank account?",
    "response": "Swiss banks have traditionally been more private and less regulated than American banks, which can make it easier to keep your personal information confidential. However, if you're not careful, you can still run into problems with privacy. For example, if you're using a bank in Switzerland that has a parent company in the United States, there may be some information about you shared between the two companies. Also, if you're traveling to Switzerland and don't use a bank that's based in Switzerland, you may still be subject to the banking laws of the country where the bank is located. This could include regulations about how much money you can take out of the country or what kind of accounts you can open. This could also include regulations about how much information you need to give to the bank. For example, if you're trying to open an account in Switzerland but you don't live in Switzerland, you may need to provide proof of address. If you don't have this proof, you may not be able to open the account. This could also include regulations about what kind of information you need to give to the bank.

    "question": "Please explain what is \"Light field\"",
    "response": "Light field technology has been used in various fields including augmented reality, virtual reality and cinematography. Light field technology uses multiple sensors to capture light from different angles and distances. The captured data can be processed to generate an image from any angle or distance, thus creating a 3D view of the scene. 3D movies are a good example of how light field technology can be used. The light field camera captures images from different angles, which are then processed to create a 3D movie that looks realistic. The captured data can also be used for other applications such as medical imaging, security surveillance and augmented reality. The captured data can be used to create a 3D view of the scene. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97,"

    "question": "What would be the effect of using a hydrophobic treatment on a ship ? And , besides expense , is there any reason not to ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Hydrophobic coatings are a type of paint that repels water. They can also repel other liquids and even some gases. The coating makes it so that water will bead up on the surface rather than spread out. This allows water to roll off of the surface and prevents water from seeping into cracks and crevices in the wood or plastic. The hydrophobic coating can also prevent the growth of mold and algae. It is especially useful for outdoor items such as boats, docks, and docks, and it can also be used on indoor items such as furniture and decks. In addition, hydrophobic coatings can help prevent the transfer of bacteria, which can lead to disease. For example, hydrophobic coatings have been used successfully to reduce the spread of bacteria in hospitals and nursing homes. Other types of coatings can be used on items that are exposed to saltwater. These types of coatings protect the item from corrosion caused by salt water. However, hydrophobic coatings do not provide protection against corrosion. Therefore, hydrophobic coatings should be applied after a corrosion resistant coating has been applied. Also, hydrophobic coatings are not always waterproof. Some hydrophobic coatings are only partially waterproof. These types of coatings allow a small amount of water to penetrate the surface. As a result, these types of coatings may need to be reapplied more often. However, hydrophobic coatings are usually much less expensive than corrosion resistant coatings. They are also easier to apply. They can be applied with a spray gun or brush. In addition, hydrophobic coatings do not change the color of the item. For example, if you want to keep your deck white, a hydrophobic coating will not make it look gray or black. Also, hydrophobic coatings do not alter the texture of the item. If you want to keep your deck smooth and shiny, a hydrophobic coating will not make it look rough and dull. Also, hydrophobic coatings do not alter the weight of the item. For example, if you want to keep your deck light and easy to move, a hydrophobic coating will not make it feel heavy. Also, hydrophobic coatings do not alter the smell of the item. For example, if you want to keep your deck smelling fresh and clean, a hydrophobic coating will not make it smell musty or old. Also, hydrophobic coatings do not alter the texture of the item. For example, if you want to keep your deck smooth and shiny, a hydrophobic"

    "question": "What do people mean when they talk about keeping same - sex marriage out of education ? I heard it in a debate the other day ... What is it and what is the argument behind it ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Same-sex marriage has nothing to do with education. The argument against same-sex marriage being taught in schools is based on two main points: 1) It is not a civil right and should not be protected by law; 2) It is not a moral issue and should not be addressed in schools. The first point says that because same-sex marriage is not a civil right and is not protected by law, it should not be taught in schools. This argument is based on the idea that if a law does not exist, then it cannot be enforced. This means that the law does not apply to everyone equally. This is called \"equal protection\" under the law. The second point says that because same-sex marriage is not a moral issue, it should not be addressed in schools. This argument is based on the idea that if a topic is not a moral issue, it should not be addressed in schools. This means that teachers should not discuss it. This is called \"separation of church and state.\" These arguments are not correct. First, the law already protects same-sex couples' rights to marry. Second, there are many moral issues that can and should be addressed in schools."

    "question": "the lack of biped land animals When dinosaurs roamed the earth there were many species that were bipedal and were strictly land based . Now only some mammals and a handful of birds are strictly biped . Why is this ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Bipedalism in Dinosaurs Bipedalism in mammals and birds evolved as an adaptation to terrestrial locomotion (walking on land). The first mammals to evolve bipedalism were probably nocturnal forest dwellers. These animals were small and had long legs, which allowed them to move quickly through trees. The evolution of bipedalism in birds may have occurred for the same reason. Birds that evolved bipedalism may have been nocturnal and lived in the trees. Many of the bird fossils found from the Mesozoic Era are not fully formed, but they do show evidence of being bipedal. In addition, some of these fossils are preserved in a state of \"flexed\" position, which suggests that they were buried while they were still alive and moving. If these animals were truly bipedal, it would be very unusual for them to become fossilized in such a position. If the animals were indeed bipedal, then the fossils must have formed after the animal died and was buried. This implies that the animals could have walked upright. Some scientists think that these animals could have walked upright because they were smaller than most modern birds. However, other scientists argue that if these animals were indeed bipedal, they must have been larger than most modern birds. The evolution of bipedalism in mammals and birds may have been driven by their need to escape predators or to find food. Mammals and birds that became bipedal may have been able to see over the heads of their prey, and they may have been able to spot food more easily. These animals may have been able to run faster than quadrupedal animals. This would have made them better able to evade predators and to catch prey."

Discovered some spots on his legs too. If i'm not wrong, there's no treatment for dengue, how would a dengue patient recover? And what are the signs that he is recovering?",
    "response": "Dengue fever (DF) is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused in humans by four serotypes of the dengue virus. Dengue is common in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, South America, Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. The most common symptoms of dengue are high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, and vomiting. The incubation period of dengue is about 3 to 7 days. Dengue is usually self-limiting and does not lead to any complications or death. However, there are two serious complications of dengue: - Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) - Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) DHF occurs in 5% to 10% of cases and DSS in 1% to 2%. DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding, and shock. Symptoms can include bleeding gums, easy bruising, nosebleeds, and fatigue. The fever may last up to 10 days and recovery is generally complete within 2 weeks. DSS is characterized by shock and circulatory failure. It occurs when blood pressure drops too low to supply oxygen to vital organs. Signs and symptoms include a sudden drop in blood pressure, rapid breathing, and a weak pulse. DSS is life-threatening and requires immediate medical care. The best way to prevent dengue is to avoid mosquito bites. You should take precautions such as using insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants, sleeping under mosquito nets, and using air conditioning or window screens to keep mosquitoes outside. There is currently no vaccine to prevent dengue. Vaccines are being developed but have not yet been approved. If you are traveling to an area where dengue is common, you should consult your health care provider about whether you need a vaccination. You should also talk to your health care provider if you have symptoms of dengue fever after traveling to an area where dengue is common."

That's because they have access to the best investment opportunities and can afford to pay higher fees for financial services. This is one reason why the wealthy continue to get richer while most Americans struggle to make ends meet. The rich get richer at the expense of the poor and middle class. This is not fair. It's time for our government to do something about this. We need to level the playing field so that everyone has a fair shot at success. We need to invest in education, training, and job creation programs so that everyone has the skills they need to compete in today's economy. We need to reform our tax system so that the wealthy pay their fair share and everyone pays their fair share. We need to ensure that everyone has access to affordable health care and quality education. We need to create a society where everyone can thrive and succeed.

We think we're awake, but we're not. We don't have the same awareness of what's happening around us that we have when we're awake. We can't see what's happening around us, or hear it, or feel it, or smell it, or taste it. We're dreaming! We're not even sure if we're dreaming! When you're sleeping, your brain is still working. But it doesn't work in the same way as when you're awake. In fact, some parts of your brain are very active when you're asleep. But other parts aren't active at all. When you're awake, your brain is active all the time. The parts of your brain that help you move around, talk, and think are active all the time. So when you're awake, you can think and move around and talk. But when you're asleep, those parts of your brain aren't active. Other parts of your brain are active, though. They're the ones that help you dream. These parts of your brain help you remember things you've learned during the day. They also help you learn new things.

Some liquids flow more easily than others. For example, oil is much easier to pour than vinegar. Some containers can hold more liquid than others. For example, a large bowl can hold more liquid than a small glass. The amount of liquid that a container can hold depends on its volume. Volume is the amount of space occupied by an object or substance. The volume of a liquid is measured in liters or milliliters.

    "response": "they look: The image above is called an electrocardiogram, or EKG, and it shows the electrical activity of the heart. Each vertical line represents a heartbeat. The length of each line is proportional to the strength of each heartbeat. By looking at this graph, doctors can tell if your heart is working properly. They can also see if you have too much stress on your heart. This stress can be from smoking cigarettes, being overweight, having high blood pressure, or from taking certain medicines. Doctors can also tell how fast your heart is beating and whether the rhythm of your heartbeat is abnormal. The results of this test can show if you have arrhythmia, which is an irregular heartbeat. The results of this test can also show if you have angina, which is chest pain caused by too little oxygen reaching the heart muscle. The results of this test can also show if you have heart failure, which means that your heart is not pumping enough blood to meet the needs of your body. The results of this test can also show if you have a heart attack, which is when one of the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to the heart becomes blocked. If you have had a heart attack, the damage to your heart will show up in the EKG as a flattened line, because the damaged heart tissue does not beat.

    "question": "Airplane Turbulence I kind of expect it when its thunder , rain , and clouds . But I just experienced the worst turbulence of my life in visually perfectly clear weather . What gives ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "experience turbulence during all phases of flight. It can occur anytime from takeoff to landing, though it's more likely to happen when you're at cruising altitude. Turbulence also tends to be more severe at cruising altitude because there's less air resistance between the plane and the surrounding air. The National Weather Service (NWS) has identified several types of turbulence: 1. Wake turbulence: This type of turbulence occurs behind large aircraft as they fly through the atmosphere. It's most common in the wake of large commercial planes that travel at high speeds. 2. Jet stream turbulence: This is turbulence caused by strong winds near jet streams, which are fast-moving air currents in the atmosphere. 3. Frontal turbulence: This type of turbulence occurs when two air masses meet. One example of this is the warm front that follows a cold front. 4. Terrain turbulence: This is turbulence caused by land or water formations such as hills, mountains, and valleys. 5. Thunderstorm turbulence: This is turbulence that's caused by thunderstorms, which are storms with lightning and heavy rain. Thunderstorms create areas of rapidly changing air pressure and temperature, which can cause turbulence. 6. Microburst turbulence: This is turbulence that's caused by the outflow of air from a thunderstorm. A microburst is a small area of low pressure that spreads out over a wide area and can have a major impact on an aircraft. The NWS has developed a system to warn pilots about microbursts. The system uses radar to detect the presence of a microburst. If a pilot detects a microburst, he or she can use the information to avoid the turbulence."

    "question": "Please explain rhesus negative incompatibility during pregnancy ? My girlfriend and I are having a baby and she is rhesus negative , I 'm confused as fuck , can you please explain ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": ", the fetus will be born with antibodies to its own red blood cells. This condition is called hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). The newborn's body will attack its own red blood cells, causing anemia and jaundice. In severe cases, HDN can lead to brain damage or even death. There are two types of HDN: hemolysis, which occurs if the mother has antibodies to her baby's blood cells and passes them on through the placenta to the fetus; and exchange transfusion, which occurs if the mother does not have antibodies but still has red blood cells from previous pregnancies that cross-react with the baby's red blood cells. Hemolysis can occur in any pregnancy. Exchange transfusions are more likely to occur if the mother has had previous pregnancies with rhesus-positive fetuses. The risk of HDN also increases with multiple births. The risk is greatest for women who have had previous pregnancies with rhesus-positive fetuses and for women who have given birth to a child with HDN. a blood test before the first pregnancy is done to determine whether the mother is rhesus positive or negative. If she is rhesus negative, she may receive a shot of Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) within 72 hours after giving birth to a rhesus-positive infant. This prevents the mother from making antibodies against the baby's red blood cells. RhoGAM is also given to women who have had previous pregnancies with rhesus-positive fetuses and who have lost a rhesus-positive fetus during the pregnancy. Women who have had previous pregnancies with rhesus-positive fetuses should receive RhoGAM after each pregnancy, regardless of whether they lost the fetus. After the first pregnancy, RhoGAM is given only if the woman has had a bleeding problem or other complication of pregnancy that might result in fetal blood loss. If the woman is rhesus negative and receives RhoGAM, she will not develop antibodies against her future rhesus-positive fetuses. If she is rhesus negative and does not receive RhoGAM, she may develop antibodies against her future rhesus-positive fetuses. If she is rhesus positive, she does not need to receive RhoGAM. However, she should receive a blood test before the first pregnancy to determine whether she has antibodies to her baby's blood cells. If she does, she will receive a shot of Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) within"
