I also heard that it is a form of lucid dream / can become one . Is that true ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nSleep paralysis is when you're trying to wake up but your body won't move. It's like when you're in the middle of dreaming and suddenly can't move. Some people say that sleep paralysis can turn into a lucid dream, which is when you realize you're dreaming and have control over what happens in the dream. However, this is not always the case and some people find it hard to transition from sleep paralysis to a lucid dream."

    "response": "system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

If they are turning at the same rate , should n't they just make sort of a buzzing sound and not a pulsing sound ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe sound that helicopter blades make is caused by the air being pushed forward by the blades as they spin. As the blades spin faster, more air is pushed forward which creates a pressure wave that travels through the air in the form of sound waves. These sound waves create the choppy or pulsing noise that we hear when watching a helicopter fly. Even though the blades are spinning at a constant speed, the way the air is pushed forward creates different pressures at different points along the blade path resulting in a series of peaks and valleys in the sound waves - this is what gives the blades their characteristic \"choppy\" sound."

Many crimes go unreported for myriads of reasons . Nevertheless , we have statistics for the percentage of B & Es , roberies or rapes that go unreported . How do they get these numbers ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe police collect data on reported crimes from the police reports they receive. They then use this information to calculate the percentages of crimes that go unreported. For example, if 100 people report a certain type of crime and only 50% of them are actually investigated, then the percentage of unreported cases would be 50%."

Just curious as to why people generally perceive people who are overweight as unattractive while we see people who are slim as being attractive or good - looking . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nPeople generally perceive overweight individuals as less attractive because of the way our brains are wired. Our brains are hardwired to prefer thin bodies and faces for several reasons. Firstly, it's believed that thinner bodies are more likely to have healthy immune systems and lower risk of disease, which makes them seem more desirable. Secondly, thinner bodies tend to be associated with higher levels of fitness and better physical health, which can also make them seem more attractive. Finally, thinner bodies often reflect good nutrition and self-care, making them appear more desirable as well."

Should n't that be a business 's ( NFL ) responsibility ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nTaxpayers front the bill for sports stadiums because they are built with public money and resources. The stadiums are typically funded through a combination of public and private sources, including government grants, corporate sponsorships, and ticket sales. While the NFL and other professional sports leagues may invest significant amounts of their own money into building or upgrading stadiums, they are ultimately responsible for ensuring that these investments are profitable. Therefore, it is only fair that taxpayers should bear some of the financial burden associated with constructing and maintaining these venues."

Specifically in the half - court : URL_0 EDIT : Clarification Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nProfessional basketball players don't backboard alley-oop to themselves in-game because it's considered unsportsmanlike behavior. Backboarding is when a player takes two dribbles before passing the ball to their teammate, which is often seen as an attempt to stall or disrupt the opposing team's offense. Backboarding also gives away possession of the ball, so it can be risky for a professional player who has already made several successful shots during the game. In addition, performing an alley-oop pass requires great skill and coordination - something that most players don't have enough time to practice due to the fast pace of professional games."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nIn a person with schizophrenia, their brain is like a computer that has been infected with a virus. This virus causes parts of the brain to malfunction and make incorrect decisions. As a result, people with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations or delusions (where they see or hear things that aren't there), as well as difficulty concentrating and making sense of what they're seeing and hearing. \n\nThe main difference between a \"normal\" brain and a schizophrenic's brain is that the latter is not able to process information in an efficient way. This means that even if someone with schizophrenia is given all the facts about something, they may still be unable to understand them or use this knowledge effectively. Additionally, people with schizophrenia often have difficulty regulating their emotions which can lead to problems with relationships and daily functioning."

The size of the penis was not important; what was important was how it looked when viewed from above. The ancient Romans and Greeks believed that an ideal body shape was symmetrical and balanced, with features that were proportionate and aesthetically pleasing. So they made sure that all of their figures had the same proportions, including the size of the penis."

It ’s my first week in chemistry class for my next degree and my nursing - oriented brain is already struggling . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n of the measurements you take will have some degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is represented by a number called \"significant figures.\" Significant figures are used when you make an estimation or measurement because it helps you understand how precise your result is. \nFor example, if you were measuring the length of an object and got 12.34 cm, then this would be written as 12.34 ± 0.05 cm (meaning plus or minus 0.05 cm). The value with the most digits is considered the most accurate, so the measurement with the highest precision would be 12.34 cm while one that has less digits such as 12.3 cm would be less precise."

Why is it popular to grab parts from overseas ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n about 10 years ago, a group of Japanese car enthusiasts started an activity called JDM (Japanese Domestic Market). This activity is all about taking cars that were originally made for the Japanese market and modifying them with parts from overseas. It's kind of like a cross between street racing and customizing. The idea is to make the car look cool and perform better than its original design.\n\nThe reason why these cars are so popular is because they have unique features that aren't found on regular cars. They usually have lots of power and acceleration due to their modified engines as well as sleek aerodynamic bodywork. Additionally, these cars often come equipped with various racing components which give them an edge over other types of vehicles in terms of performance and handling. Plus, the fact that they're built for Japan means that they have access to high quality materials when making modifications - something not always available elsewhere in the world.\n\nSo basically what makes JDM so special is the combination of creativity, technology and passion combined together - all aimed at creating something new out of old parts."

(zero factorial) is defined as 1 because it's the only way to make sense of the equation that is used to calculate factorials. The equation is n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... x 2 x 1. If we plug in 0 for n, we get 0! = 0 x (-1) x (-2) x ... x 2 x 1. This can't be simplified further without making it undefined or imaginary numbers, so we must say that 0! = 1. Similarly, 1!

Is it a culmination of unconscious intelligence or something else ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Intuition is the ability to know things without thinking about them first . It 's kind of like a gut feeling or an instinctive understanding . You might get an intuition about something when you see or hear about it - it can be right or wrong but usually gives you some sort of clue as to what may happen next . Intuition is not always right though ; sometimes it can be misleading because we don't always have all the information needed before making decisions .  #intuition"

Can someone explain the steps he used to get prove the theorem ? Thanks Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n \n\n 1) We start with the equation (x + y)^n = x^n + y^n + ... + y^n.\n \n2) We then use the fact that (x + y)^n = (x^2 + 2xy + y^2)(x^(n-2) + (n-1)x^(n-3)y +...+ y^(n-2)). This means that the left side of the equation can be written as a sum of terms involving only even powers of x and y.\n \n3) Using this expression for (x+y)^n , we can write the original equation as: x^n + y^n +...+ y^n = (x^2 + 2xy + y^2)(x^(n-2)+ (n-1)x^(n-3)y+...+y^(n-2)).\n \n4) By expanding out all the terms on both sides of the equation, we arrive at an expression for x^n + y^n in terms of x and y alone . \n   \n5) After simplifying this expression using algebraic identities , we obtain a relationship between x^n and y^n which is true for all values of n greater than two . This proves Fermat’s last theorem ."

Glitches are errors or bugs in the game which make it difficult to play and sometimes even impossible. When a game has a glitch, it means that something is not working correctly and could lead to safety hazards or other problems. \n\nIt's important to understand that when a product contains defects or malfunctions, such as a video game with a glitch, it should be treated as if it is defective. In this case, the consumer may be entitled to receive either a full refund or replacement of the faulty item."

Should n't it get hotter since we 're closer to the sun ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n because of the way that the sun shines and shines and shines on us, we think that it should get hotter as we go higher up in the sky.  But instead it gets colder!  So why does this happen?  It's because the air at high altitudes is very thin, which means there aren't as many molecules of air to absorb the sunlight's heat energy.  As a result ,the temperature at higher altitudes tends to be cooler than at ground level ."

Also one can start saving money by making small changes in daily life such as buying products with less packaging or using public transport instead of driving oneself etc .  Additionally setting up goals for financial success like saving for retirement is important so that future needs will not be met from current income but rather through accumulated funds . \n  Furthermore it is beneficial if one decides early on how much money they would like to have saved up before reaching certain milestones (e.g., being able to retire at age 65) since this helps create motivation towards achieving said goals .  Finally , understanding how different investment vehicles work (such as stocks vs bonds) can help make informed decisions when allocating one's own personal wealth ."

I do n't understand how you can have a dry sandy landscape right next to an ocean and not have any precipitation and vegetation . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe desert meets the ocean in places like Saudi Arabia because of a phenomenon called a coastal lowland. This is when a large body of water (like an ocean) meets with a land area that has little or no rainfall. The lack of rainfall causes the soil to become very dry and sandy, which creates the conditions for a desert. Even though the ocean is nearby, it doesn't provide enough moisture to support plants and animals. As a result, these areas become deserts."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n, 1080i and 1080p are different types of high definition video that can be found on televisions . The main difference between them is the number of horizontal lines per frame of video (1080i means there are 1080 lines in each frame while 1080p means there are 2160 lines ). In addition , 1080i has a higher refresh rate than 1080p which makes it smoother when watching movies or playing games on your TV . \nAs far as which one is better - both have their own advantages depending on what you want out of your viewing experience . 1080i might be preferable if you want an extra smooth picture but prefer not to spend so much money ; whereas 1080p could give you sharper images at lower cost but may not look as smooth . Ultimately though , both options will provide great visuals and should be chosen based upon personal preference ."

I know some environmentalists oppose wind power , and wondered what the reasons are . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWind energy is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy available today, as it can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.  Wind energy can also provide significant benefits in terms of energy security and national sovereignty; it can be produced locally without relying on imported fuels from distant countries or regions. \n  Wind energy has been around for centuries already and it continues to grow rapidly as more countries invest in this clean form of energy.  In addition, wind energy projects often have minimal environmental impacts when compared with other forms of power generation such as coal-fired plants which release large amounts of pollutants into the atmosphere every day."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe calibre of a bullet is the diameter of its barrel when it is fired. It is usually measured in millimeters, but sometimes also in inches or fractions of an inch. The most common calibres for military and civilian use are .22, .38, 9mm, 12ga and .45. When describing bullets with calibres, people often use both metric (mm) and imperial units (cal). For example, a 9mm bullet would be described as being \"9 millimetres\" or simply \"9 mm\", while a .38 bullet would be described as having a \"38-calibre\" or \"38mm\". These descriptions can be interchangeable, so you could say that a 9mm bullet has a calibre of .38 if you wanted to."

This is when two or more women have similar menstrual cycles after they've lived together for a while. It has been observed that women who live together tend to experience their periods about the same time each month.  This phenomenon is known as \"menstrual synchrony\" and it is thought to be due to shared environmental factors such as diet, stress levels, temperature and humidity among other things."

Title says it all . Just a confused individual . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe length of your stream is determined by the amount of urine you have in your bladder. When you feel like you have to pee but not much comes out, that means there's only a small amount of urine in your bladder. So it takes less time for the stream to empty. On the other hand, if you feel an urgent need to pee and it lasts for a longer period of time, that means there's more urine in your bladder so it takes longer for it to empty completely."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n long time ago , people thought that black was the best color to make roads because it reflects heat and keeps the roads cooler in the summer. Asphalt is made from the remains of dead plants and animals which gives it its dark color. It also contains chemicals that help prevent water from seeping into the road surface and making it slippery.  As for other materials - while concrete can be used as an alternative , it is more expensive than asphalt and requires more maintenance. Also concrete will not provide the same level of protection against water penetration as asphalt does."

You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nWhy plants can sit in the same soil without needing new nutrients do n't they eventually use up all the nutrients ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n plant cannot grow without having access to new nutrients .  The plants that we see in our gardens and in the fields are able to get the nutrients they need from the soil because there are many different types of nutrients that are available in the soil .  These nutrients include things like nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium and other minerals which are necessary for plants to grow healthy .  In addition , there are also organic materials such as humus which is made up of decomposed plant material and animal waste products which provide additional nutrients for plants .  As long as these types of nutrients are present in sufficient amounts then plants will be able to continue growing even if they have not been fertilized recently .  So basically plants don’t need any more nutrients than what is already present in the soil ; otherwise they would run out of nutrients after some time ."

This is an instinctive response known as the \"vomiting reflex.\"  Involuntary reactions happen when our bodies respond automatically to external stimuli without us being aware of what is causing it. When you watch someone else vomit, your body may perceive this as a threat or danger and react by inducing the same symptoms in yourself as a form of self-protection."

Plus there are usually plenty of close-ups of actors' faces so that we can see how their expressions change throughout the story line.

How is text input converted into an action by a machine ? I just do n't understand where it converts from data to physical action . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWhen you write code in a programming language, it tells the computer what to do and how to do it. The computer then uses this information to carry out the commands that have been given, which can result in a physical action being taken. For example, if you write code that says \"turn on the lights,\" the computer will use its instructions to turn on the lights in your house. In order for the computer to be able to perform these actions, it needs to be connected to a device or piece of hardware that can physically respond to those commands. So, when you type in text commands, they are first turned into digital signals which are then sent over wires or through radio waves to reach the appropriate device or hardware component. Once there, the signals instruct the device to take certain actions such as turning on lights, moving motors etc., thus performing whatever task has been specified by the user via their programing language."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n pH is a measure of how acidic or basic something is. It's measured on a scale from 0-14 with 7 being neutral. So if you go from a pH of 7 to a pH of 8, that's only an increase of one whole number, which is why it's not considered a big change. But when you go from a pH of 7 to a pH of 9, that's an increase of two whole numbers - or an order of magnitude. That means the difference between those two pH levels is much bigger than just the one-unit difference in the first case!"

I 'm constantly having to clean off my headphones and out of my ears and it does n't seem like my friends ever do . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nEarwax is a natural substance that protects the inside of our ears from dust, bacteria, and other foreign objects. It's produced by glands in the outer ear canal and helps keep the ear canal moist and clean. As you age, your body produces more earwax which can build up over time and cause issues with hearing or cleaning out debris from the ear. Some people naturally produce more earwax than others, so it’s possible for some people to have more than their peers."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWell-known Windows shortcuts like CTRL+C and CTRL+V do not work in the command line because they are designed for use with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In a GUI, these keys copy text from one place and paste it into another. However, when you are working in a command line interface, there is no visual feedback or window where you can see what text has been copied and pasted. So instead of using the standard keyboard shortcuts, you need to use special commands such as 'copy' and 'paste'."

Thanks for helping out a noob ! Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n class is like a template that defines what an object should look like and how it should behave.  is the special syntax used when defining a class - it tells the computer to create a new type of object with specific properties and methods (functions).  is used for defining methods (functions) within a class - these methods define how an object can interact with other objects or perform certain tasks.  is used for creating instances (objects) from a class definition - this creates an individual object which has its own set of properties and methods defined by the class.  is used for calling methods on objects - this allows you to use the methods defined in a class directly on your objects without having to explicitly write out each method separately every time you want to call it.  is used for creating variables that refer to instances of classes - these variables hold values associated with specific objects created from their corresponding classes.  is used for defining functions outside of any classes - these functions don't have access to any class-specific information but instead operate independently of all classes; they may be called by other parts of the program as needed without requiring any additional setup such as defining a class first . \n # is used for commenting out sections of code - comments allow programmers to document their code and provide explanations about what certain lines do without changing functionality itself ; this helps future developers understand existing code better so they can maintain it more easily . \n & is used for specifying boolean operators such as && (and), || (or), ! (! not) which are used for logical comparisons between two expressions evaluated at runtime; these operators enable complex operations involving multiple conditions being checked simultaneously rather than sequentially one after another . \n $ is used for specifying variable names which contain dollar signs ($) at their beginning indicating they represent user inputted data types such as strings , numbers etc; this allows dynamic typing where variables can change type depending on usage context rather than being statically typed at compile time . \n % is used for formatting output strings according to specified formats including inserting formatted values into placeholders found within string literals ; this enables easy generation of formatted output without manually inserting values manually every time needed . \n # is used for specifying indentation levels which show hierarchical relationships between blocks of code allowing clear separation between different levels of logic execution while still keeping track of which block belongs where when nested structures get too deep ; this helps improve readability significantly compared to unindented code alone . \n # is used for specifying multi-line comments spanning across multiple lines ; this provides even greater flexibility than single line comments alone allowing longer explanations about what certain blocks do without"

And why ca n't I always remember them ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n dream is just like a story that we tell ourselves about what we want or need right now . We make up the characters and the settings ; we even create our own dialogue with each other .  The more vividly we can imagine this story , the better it will help us feel better when we wake up from sleep .  But sometimes  our mind decides not to let us remember our dreams fully after waking up ; this happens because of different things such as fatigue , stress , lack of sleep etc ."

Even things that are n't wrong with it would be helpful . I really want to form an opinion but I do n't know enough / need it dumbed down . Thank you ! Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe punishment for sex offenders in the U.S. is not always effective. For example, many sex offenders are released early from prison and have no access to treatment or support services, which makes them more likely to reoffend. Additionally, some states have harsh laws that allow for lengthy sentences without providing adequate resources for rehabilitation and reintegration into society."

Aside from the kick - start of life happening perchance , this is the only thing I really struggle with as far as evolution . What made the first single celled organism decide to propagate ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe first living cell decided to divide because it wanted to make more of itself. Like any other organism, it needed to reproduce in order to survive and thrive. By dividing into two cells, it was able to increase its population and ensure the continuation of its kind. This was an important step in the evolution of life on Earth, as it allowed for the growth and diversification of different types of organisms."

You hear it all the time when you microwave , pretty much , anything . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n It's the same thing that happens when you're microwaving food. You hear a little bit of static noise first, then after a while you'll hear some popping and sizzling sounds coming from the microwave.  That's because when you put something in a microwave oven and heat it up, it causes the food to vibrate at certain frequencies which creates those popping and sizzling sounds."

It 's like when you try to figure out how to tie your shoes without looking at them first or when you try to guess what someone is thinking without asking them directly . It also means being able to think logically about something instead of just reacting emotionally . For example if someone gives you an order but doesn't tell why they gave it , then you need use critical thinking in order come up with possible reasons behind their action . The same goes for solving math problems - instead of just guessing answers , you can use logic reasoning along with some basic knowledge about numbers etc . In short - Critical Thinking teaches us how to analyze information objectively rather than relying solely on our feelings or opinions ."

    "response": "system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nwhy manual cars are dying off even though they 're more fuel efficient and keep the driver focused Manual transmission . They 're more fun , too . And * * cheaper . * * Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n When you drive a car with an automatic transmission you have to press a button every time you want to change gears, which is very annoying.  Also, most people don't know how to do it or don't have the patience to learn.  Plus it takes longer to shift from one gear to another than with a manual car.  It also uses more fuel because it has to constantly be changing gears while driving.  In addition, it's harder on your car because it puts extra strain on all of its parts including the engine and transmission system.  Lastly, when you're driving a manual car you get to feel like you're in control of everything - you can feel the car accelerating as soon as you put your foot down on the gas pedal; you can hear the engine revving when you shift gears; you can even feel yourself moving around inside the car while shifting through different speeds - all these things make it much more enjoyable than driving an automatic vehicle!"

The Salem Witch Trials were a series of hearings and executions in colonial Massachusetts where people accused of witchcraft were tried and convicted. There were many different reasons why someone might have been accused of being a witch, but it was generally believed that these people had powers over nature and could harm others through their evil spells. The trials lasted from 1692 until 1693 when they were finally stopped due to lack of evidence against the accused individuals ."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Cheap oil is a good thing because it makes energy more affordable for everyone and helps our economy grow. But sometimes people get scared when prices drop too low because they think it means there won't be enough supply to meet demand in the future. However , this is usually just temporary and does not indicate any real problem with supply or demand in general . In fact , some argue that cheap oil could actually help reduce environmental pollution since companies may have less incentive to use dirty methods of extracting energy if costs are lower than usual .  Additionally , cheaper oil can lead to more jobs being created as new businesses open up in areas where oil production takes place . Overall , cheap oil is beneficial for many reasons ."

The hatred of Jews was not built up over many years, but rather began in the late 1800s and early 1900s with the rise of antisemitic movements in Europe. These movements blamed Jews for various social problems and saw them as a threat to the stability of European society. The persecution of Jews began in 1933 when Nazi Germany came to power under Adolf Hitler. Under Hitler's rule, Jews were stripped of their rights and subjected to discrimination, violence, and forced labor. In 1941, the Nazis began deporting Jews to concentration camps where they were systematically murdered."

Celiacs cannot eat gluten, which is a protein found in wheat and other grains. Gluten-free foods can be easier for them to digest, so they don’t have any digestive issues. For those who aren’t celiac, eating gluten-free foods may still be beneficial. People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other digestive disorders may find that avoiding gluten helps their symptoms. In addition, some people may feel better after removing gluten from their diet, even if they don't have an allergy or sensitivity to it."

When you flush the toilet or turn on the shower or faucet, the water is cold and wet, which makes your cat feel uncomfortable and scared. Even if they have never been wet before, their natural instincts tell them that water can be dangerous so they react with fear."

It moves very fast through space and can travel in straight lines without being affected by gravity. However, when it enters a black hole, its path is bent by the strong gravitational pull of the black hole. This causes the light to \"fall\" into the black hole instead of continuing on its straight line path."

Similarly, if someone says \"you don't really look like a Taylor\", it means that the person's features are different from those of the person named Taylor. This is because when we see someone we think of what they are called and how they should look like based on their name - so if they don't look the same way, then we assume that they aren't really that person."

When you sing on pitch, your voice is in tune with the instrument or song that you are singing along with. The correct way to sing on pitch is to practice and develop good vocal technique. This includes proper breathing, posture, and resonance as well as using correct hand positions when playing an instrument such as piano or guitar. In addition, it is important to pay attention to the sound of your own voice - if you notice that your voice is too high or low then this could indicate that there may be an issue with either your technique or ear training skills ."

When you drink the water, your body tries to get rid of the extra salt by removing water from other parts of your body. This process is called osmosis and causes dehydration.

The ads can be viewed on TV at home or work, making it easy for people to learn about what these companies do.

What do they gain from this ? Is this secretly a scam somehow ? I 'm starting to see this trend all over the place . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n promotions are often free because they are trying to get customers to sign up or buy something else. The company is hoping that once you've signed up, they can start sending you emails with more offers and promotions that you might find useful. By offering free products, companies hope that people will be more likely to sign up and give them their personal information so they can reach out later with more deals. Additionally, some companies may use these types of promotions as an opportunity to test out new products before releasing them on the market in order to gauge consumer interest and determine which features work best."

When you hear these kinds of music it makes your body feel warm all over but at the same time it feels cold too - like you have goosebumps all over. This feeling is called 'chills'. It's not just about the sound or lyrics of the song though - it's also how it makes you feel emotionally connected with whatever is playing back in your mind. So even if you don't understand what the words mean, hearing them can still give you chills because they remind you of something important in life that you care about deeply."

In the United States, it is customary to leave a small tip after each drink or order, typically around $1 per drink. This amount may seem small, but it can add up quickly when you are at a busy bar with many customers. It is not intended to compensate the workers for their labor; rather, it is an expression of gratitude for their service."

It should be removed surgically as soon as possible. The surgery could potentially be performed on an outpatient basis, but whether or not she will need to stay overnight will depend on the specific circumstances of her case. Your daughter should discuss all of her options with her doctor before deciding how to proceed."

Since your symptoms seem to be worsening over time, it would be wise to seek medical attention as soon as possible."

Why does this happen and how can I stop it ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n When you cook or heat up food, some of the nutrients in it can be lost.  For example, when you boil potatoes they lose their vitamin C content.  Also, when you microwave vegetables they may lose some of their color and flavor which means they don't taste as good.  So it is best to eat your vegetables raw whenever possible so that all the nutrients are preserved!"

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Timeshares are kind of like hotels that you own for free , but only for a limited amount of time each year . They are usually sold as vacation packages and give you access to a specific property at certain times of the year . The catch is that in order to make money off of it , you need to sell your \"ownership\" back to the company after your holiday period is over - this means that you don't get any real benefit from owning it unless you plan on doing something else with it like renting out rooms or using it as an investment property . As far as who makes the profit goes - it depends on how long the contract lasts - typically speaking the company will take about half of whatever value was paid when purchasing it ."

Like where does the drug come from in the first place ? How 'd they make it and stuff ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n The internet has been used for a long time to buy and sell illegal goods. But recently, people have started using the dark web — which is an area of the internet that's hidden from search engines — as a platform to buy and sell drugs like cocaine and heroin. \n\n  In order to get these drugs on the dark web, dealers must find sources of supply. They can either source their own drugs or purchase them from other sellers on the dark web. To make sure that they have enough stock of their products, dealers will often create fake websites that look legitimate but actually just serve as fronts for selling drugs."

I saw a Vice documentary about this subject but I 'm still not sure why . They could date whoever they want , they are gorgeous ! Are Japanese men so bad with women ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n of course! It's because Japanese women want to be treated like special and beautiful things. They feel that if they pay for male company it makes them seem more valuable and desirable. It also gives them an opportunity to show off their looks which can make other people jealous. Additionally, it allows the man who is paying to feel special and appreciated which can lead to him being more attentive in the relationship."

How does insulin resistance cause fat storage if those calories consumed need to be burned in some way anyway , according to the law of thermodynamics ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Thermodynamics says that we must burn calories in order to maintain our body's energy levels, so when someone has insulin resistance, they may not have enough insulin to help their body break down sugar and turn it into energy. As a result, the extra sugar gets stored as fat in the body.  We hope this explanation helps you understand how insulin resistance can lead to weight gain!"

Therefore, if you try to build something that does not require input of energy in order to function (like a perpetual motion machine), you will find that there is always some other form of energy required which was not accounted for at the beginning.  In short, perpetual motion machines are just not possible!"

He s been unconscious since the fall. is there any hope he can come out of this and be the grandfather I remember.\nassistant\nThe chances of recovery from a brain hemorrhage caused by a fall depend on many factors, including the size of the bleed, the amount of pressure on the brain, and the overall health of the individual. In your grandfather's case, the fact that he has already undergone surgery and is in the ICU suggests that he is receiving medical attention as soon as possible. \n\nThe chances of full recovery will likely depend on how well his body responds to treatment and how much damage was done to his brain during the incident. If his condition improves over time, it may be possible for him to make a full recovery and return to his previous level of function. However, without more information about his specific situation it would not be possible to give an accurate estimate of his chances of recovery."

It's important to note that it is not common for an infection to cause difficulty in urination immediately following sexual activity, but it is still something to consider. In addition, excessive fluid intake may also lead to difficulty in urination. It is best to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide proper guidance and treatment options."

It lasted from August 1914 to November 1918 and resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. The war began when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia over allegations that Serbia had assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. This led to a series of alliances among European powers which ultimately drew Germany into the conflict as well. As a result of this chain reaction, World War I quickly spread throughout Europe and beyond into other parts of the world."

EDIT : Damn that blew up Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nBlonde-haired people often have dark pubic hair because the hair color in this area is determined by genetics and not by the color of the hair on the head. Pubic hair color can vary depending on an individual's genetic makeup and hormone levels, but generally tends to be darker than the hair on the head. Redheads tend to have red pubic hair because their hair color is also determined by genetics and not by the color of their hair on the head.

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nIn the olden days, pants were made to fit men's legs and were designed for practicality. Skirts, on the other hand, were made to cover women's legs and were designed to give them a more feminine look. Men had bigger genitalia than women so they needed more coverage, which is why pants were originally designed for them. Women also had bigger genitalia than men so they needed more coverage too, but it was not as necessary since their genitalia could easily be hidden under a skirt."

I have wondering this my ENTIRE LIFE . End my quest for answers , redditors . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Knitted stuff has lots of holes in it but that doesn't mean it's not warm.  The holes in the stuff create air pockets and these air pockets help to insulate your body.  It's like when you take a bath or shower - the hot water creates bubbles in the water which helps to keep you warm.  So even though knitted stuff might seem like it wouldn't be very warm, it actually can be!"

I have heard of so many ways and polymers and other stuff created to purify water , yet I have never heard of them being used in real life . Why is it so ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWell, imagine you have a bunch of different methods for cleaning your clothes - some use soap and water, others use bleach or detergent. Some might even use special chemicals. But no matter which one you choose, they all work equally well. The same applies to purifying water. There are many ways that can be used to remove impurities from water such as distillation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange and activated carbon filtration. However, because each method has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of impurity present in the water, it would be difficult to implement them all in practice without knowing exactly what kind of contaminants need to be removed first. That's why only certain types of purification systems get used - those that best fit the needs of a particular area or situation."

I do n't mean explain what you experience personally , I mean what happens physically where rubbing your genitals results eventually in an orgasm ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n When you have an orgasm, it is the release of sexual tension that occurs in your body. Your brain sends signals to your muscles and glands telling them to contract and release in a coordinated way. This process creates waves of electrical activity in your nervous system which can be felt throughout your body. The contraction and release of these waves causes physical sensations such as tingling or warmth in certain areas of your body while other areas may feel more relaxed or loose. These sensations usually start from the area being stimulated and move upwards towards the head. In some cases these sensations may also extend into other parts of the body depending on how aroused you are at the time of orgasm."

In fact, many people around the world drink milk without any problem. This includes Japanese schoolchildren! They are able to do this because their bodies have an enzyme called lactase which helps them digest milk. The lactase enzyme is normally produced when we are babies but as we get older it starts to decrease in our bodies. So while some people may be lactose intolerant and struggle with drinking milk, others like the Japanese children are able to drink it just fine!"

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe Earth's axis is tilted at an angle and it takes 24 hours for the Earth to complete one full rotation on its axis. This means that during certain times of the year, different parts of the Earth receive more or less sunlight than others. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, this part of the Earth experiences colder temperatures because there is less direct sunlight reaching those areas. The coldest days of the year usually occur when the Northern Hemisphere is farthest away from the sun - which is why these days tend to be after the winter solstice."

The size of the wound and the fact that it was only slightly open should have provided some natural protection against potential infections. If you are concerned about any possible infections, you may want to take an over-the-counter antibiotic for a few days to prevent any potential issues.

I actually joined reddit to ask this question , could n't find the answer online . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n white dwarf star is a type of star that has run out of fuel and is no longer able to produce energy through nuclear fusion. This means that the star can no longer shine brightly and instead becomes dimmer over time. As the star loses its brightness, it also loses some of its mass in the process which makes it heavier than before. In order for us humans or robots  to mine such a star we would need special equipment like spaceships equipped with powerful lasers capable of vaporizing material off of the surface of the star. Additionally, we would need advanced technology that allows us extract valuable elements from these stars without damaging them too much so they remain intact when we leave."

Is it true that GE only pays an effective tax rate of 4.2 % ? How is this possible ? Please explain all of the aspects of this -- it seems insane to me . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nYes, it is possible for companies like GE to pay very low effective tax rates. This happens because the company is able to use a variety of strategies and loopholes to reduce their tax liability. Some of these strategies include using international tax havens, claiming deductions for research and development costs, and taking advantage of tax credits and other favorable provisions. The most common method used by large corporations like GE is what's known as \"transfer pricing,\" which involves artificially moving profits from one country to another in order to minimize overall global tax obligations."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n person's race refers to their ancestry, which is determined by physical characteristics such as skin color or hair type. an ethnicity refers to a group of people who share common cultural traditions, beliefs, values, customs and practices. \nThe distinction between race and ethnicity developed over time as societies became more aware of the differences between different groups of people. While some races may have similar ethnicities (such as European Americans), it is not always true - there are many examples where two groups share the same racial background but have very different ethnic identities (for example: Black Americans vs Indian Americans)."

However, recent research has shown that this may not be the case and that humans may have evolved from other hominid species as well. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that humans may have interbred with Neanderthals at some point in history which could have had an impact on our genetic makeup.  Also, having Neanderthal DNA has been linked to an increase in mental health issues such as depression and anxiety; however, more research is needed in order to fully understand any potential connections between these two factors."

When people who are not deaf read we say each word in our head . If someone was born deaf and has never heard anything before how do they have that voice or how does the reading process go . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWhen a person who is not deaf reads, they use their eyes to look at the words on the page and their brain tells them what those words mean. The brain then creates an image of what the words sound like when spoken out loud, which allows the reader to \"hear\" the words as they read. A person who is deaf cannot hear sounds with their ears so they must rely on other senses such as touch, sight and smell to interpret what they are reading. They might use sign language or Braille if necessary, or ask someone else to read it aloud for them."

Thanks\nassistant\nIt is not uncommon for children to experience coughs and phlegm during colds. However, coughing up blood and vomiting can be a sign of a more serious condition such as pneumonia or bronchitis. If your child's symptoms persist or worsen, it is important to seek medical attention from a qualified healthcare provider."

What would it feel like if you tried to breath in that instance ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nSo imagine you're floating in the middle of space, and you try to breathe in. It's going to be really hard! Your body is not used to breathing in zero gravity, so your lungs won't be able to expand properly. This will make it difficult to draw air into your lungs, and you may even start feeling dizzy or disoriented. If you try too hard, you could actually cause yourself harm by trying to inhale too much air at once. So remember - don't try this at home!"

They also believed that the Bible said God would punish the Egyptians for enslaving the Jews, so they thought it was justified. They didn't see the similarities between the Egyptians and themselves because they were focused on their own goals. They justified their slavetrading by saying that God had given them permission and that the punishment of Egypt would eventually come."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n is a form of argumentation that assumes the conclusion to be true and then tries to prove it. It starts off with an assumption that something is true and then proceeds to try and prove it. The problem is that when you assume something is true, there are no rules about how you can prove it.  You can use any method you want, even if it doesn't make sense!  For example: If I tell you that my dog has four legs, then you should be able to see for yourself that it does indeed have four legs right now - because I said so!  However, if someone else tells me that my dog has six legs then I cannot simply dismiss their statement as being wrong without providing evidence against them first - they could be right after all!"

Or do OTC drugs tend to be so safe that \" maximum \" is relatively low ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nMaximum strength means that the medicine has the highest amount of active ingredients in it. Sometimes, these high levels of active ingredients can cause unwanted side effects. For example, if you take too much acetaminophen (Tylenol) - which is commonly found in over-the-counter pain relievers - it can lead to liver damage. So while \"maximum strength\" may seem like it would help more, sometimes it could actually cause harm."

Mine humps her bed vigorously and shamelessly , for example . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n dog in heat is basically saying she's ready to have puppies and wants someone to rub up against her . It's kind of like when you're on your period - the more attention you get from boys at school the better!  Also remember that all animals have an instinctive urge to mark their territory so sometimes it can look like they're humping things when they aren't actually having sex ."

You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nWhy can I rename an mp3 file while it 's in use , but not a word / powerpoint / folder ? just noticed this while playing some music on my media player . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n few years ago, I decided to make my own version of the song \"I Will Always Love You\" because I really love it and thought it would be cool to have my own copy. So I downloaded it from the internet and opened up the file in my computer. When I was done listening to the song, I wanted to rename it so that I could remember what it was when I listened again later on. However, when I tried to rename the file, it wouldn't let me do it - even though I knew for sure that the song was still open and playing on my media player! This puzzled me at first because I thought maybe there was something wrong with the file itself or perhaps my computer had become corrupted somehow. But then I remembered that there is actually a way around this problem - you simply need to close any other programs running on your computer before trying to rename the file. Once I did that, it worked perfectly fine and allowed me to give the file a new name without any issues whatsoever!"

Right when you go off a drop your body gives you that \" droppy feeling \" and I was wondering - what causes that ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWhen you drop off a roller coaster, your body is experiencing an adrenaline rush. The sudden change in gravity and the sudden stop of the coaster can cause your body to release a lot of energy in the form of adrenaline. This adrenaline rush causes your heart rate to increase, your muscles to tense up, and your blood pressure to rise. All of these things combined create the feeling of being \"dropped\" or \"droppy\" in your stomach."

I m not much of a scientist or a doctor but .... if a diabetic persons body ca nt handle sugar / process it properly . Why is it not consider an allergy . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n person with diabetes can't handle sugar or process it properly because their body does not have enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body absorb and use glucose (sugar) from food. When a person with diabetes eats food that contains sugar, their body doesn't produce enough insulin to properly process the sugar. This causes the sugar levels in their blood to rise higher than normal, which is why they need to take medication or use insulin shots to help lower these levels. So even though they can't handle sugar as well as someone without diabetes can, it's not considered an allergy because there is no immune response involved."

These include looking at the age of the piece, the quality of the materials used, how well it was made, its condition and whether or not it has any unique features that make it stand out from other works. Some contemporary artworks are more valuable than others because they have been produced in recent times and reflect current trends in art.

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n The speed of your internet depends on several factors. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) decides how fast you can access the internet. Some ISPs offer faster connections than others and some have slower ones.  Also, if you live in an area with lots of people using the same network, it may be slower than an area where there aren't many other users online.  To get a faster internet connection, you could try contacting your ISP to ask for a speed increase or look into different service providers that may offer higher speeds."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Imagine if you could take a piece of paper and fold it in half over and over again until it was super tiny! That's what happens with hair when it is growing. The hair gets smaller and smaller as it grows, but it also curls up on itself. This is called 'curvature'. Curvature means that each strand of hair bends in different ways depending on how it was grown. Some people have very straight hair because their hair didn't curve much at all; others have curly hair because their hair curved a lot more than normal. It's all about how the hair was formed when it was growing!"

As you drive faster and faster, you begin to feel dizzy and lightheaded, but then you look at the clock and see that it's still only 10:30am! That can't be right, can it? But no matter how hard you try, time just won't seem to move forward as quickly as you want it to. It seems like every second feels like an eternity!  So what gives? Well, that's because of something called special relativity which states that time slows down when things move very fast (like cars). This means that even though you may think that time is passing slowly while you're traveling near light speed, it actually passes much more quickly than expected due to this effect known as time dilation ."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nDefamation laws and free speech are different in that defamation laws protect an individual's reputation and prevent them from being falsely accused of something. This is done by making it illegal to make false statements about someone which could damage their reputation. Free speech on the other hand is the right to express one's opinions without fear of punishment or retaliation. It allows people to speak out on various topics as long as they don't violate any laws such as inciting violence or libel (which is similar to defamation).

Or is it something else in the brain that makes people smart ? I assume there is no way to \" grow \" more brain cells either , is there ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nYes, having more brain cells would make you smarter. The brain has billions of neurons, which are like little switches that help process information and send messages throughout the body. Each neuron can form thousands of connections with other neurons, creating complex networks that allow us to think, learn and remember things. While we cannot grow more neurons directly, we can increase our cognitive abilities through exercise, diet, sleep and learning new skills."

Alternatively , if they are , why is it such common practice , e.g. \" warning shots \" , salutes to dead soldiers , etc . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n because when bullets fired upward , the gravity will make them fall down instead of going up . This is why we cannot shoot bullets upward any more than we can fly a plane backward or walk backwards .  's  bullet s are always aimed downward and not upward in order to maximize their effectiveness . Also , when firing a gun at someone it is important that the aim be correct so that the bullet hits its target ; otherwise there would be no point in shooting at all ."

Because in my mind it makes no sense that something hard like a diamond or bullet proof glass let the light in , but squishy and soft stuff like play doh or paint , can effectively block the light . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nObjects become transparent or translucent when their structure allows light to pass through them. In other words, the object has small openings that allow the light to pass through. Transparent objects have very small openings which allow all the light to pass through, whereas translucent objects have larger openings that only allow some of the light to pass through. \nDiamonds and bullet proof glass are examples of transparent objects because they have tiny crystals arranged in such a way that allows light to pass through without being blocked. On the other hand, play doh and paint are examples of translucent objects since they contain materials that scatter light and therefore block some of it from passing through."

Beatles songs are often broken up when you listen through one headphone because the music and vocals are not in sync with each other.  When you put on a pair of headphones, the sound is directed directly into one ear canal which causes the music to sound distorted and muffled on that side. In order to fix this problem, you should try using noise cancellation headphones which can help eliminate any unwanted sounds so that you can enjoy your favorite songs without interruption."

If diamonds are valuable ( through artificial scarcity ) and very small , why are they not stolen in large amounts by impoverished workers ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n In order to protect their precious diamonds from theft, diamond mines use several security measures. First, the mine has guards on duty who patrol the area and watch for any suspicious activity. Second, there are cameras installed in strategic locations that record footage which can be reviewed later if necessary. Thirdly, workers are only allowed into certain areas of the mine with special passes and they must remain vigilant at all times in case someone tries to steal their diamonds. Lastly, some mines have even installed alarms that go off when an intruder is detected near the diamonds so that authorities can quickly arrive and take action. By using these preventative measures, diamond mines can ensure that their valuable resources remain safe from being stolen by impoverished workers."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWhen you are waiting to pee, your body is preparing for the moment when you can release the pressure. Your bladder is full of urine, but it's not ready to be released yet. In order to do this, your brain sends signals to your bladder telling it to get ready. This takes some time, so you have to wait. Once the signal is sent, the muscles in your bladder contract and force the urine out. The process can take several seconds, depending on how much urine has built up in your bladder."

It's like when you see little drops of water forming on the outside of a cold drink container - those are tiny droplets of condensation!  This happens all around us every day, even though we don't always notice it .  When air contains lots of water vapor (like after rain) , it will start to cool down and then become full of tiny water droplets which we can see as clouds in the sky or mist near bodies of water .  The more warm air there is mixed with cool air , the more condensation occurs .  So next time you take a shower , watch how your bathroom mirror gets all foggy because of condensation happening on its surface ."

Everytime I look at a helicopter it just does n't make sense to me that it would stay in the air . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nA helicopter is able to stay in the air because of the way its rotors spin and tilt. The blades are attached to the main shaft which spins around the center of the helicopter. As they spin, the blades create lift by pushing down on the air, creating upward force. This upward force is called \"thrust\" and it allows the helicopter to fly. The blades can also be tilted so that they point up or down, allowing the helicopter to hover and move forward, backward, or sideways."

    "response": "system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nall the different sugar substitutes . Can someone explain the differences between all the sugar substitutes and maybe add what some of the typical stigmas are associated with them ? I know that Aspartame gets a lot of negative press , but how are the others different ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n all the different sugar substitutes.  These include artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (also known as Nutrasweet), saccharin (also known as Sweet'N Low), sucralose (Splenda) and cyclamate; natural alternatives such as stevia, erythritol, monk fruit extract; low calorie sweeteners like sugar alcohols such as xylitol and sorbitol; and other non-caloric sweeteners including glycerol and polyols. \nThe most common stigma associated with these substitutes is that they are \"too sweet\" or \"too artificial\". However there are several reasons why people may choose to use these substitutes over regular table sugar: first they have lower calories which can help with weight loss goals; second they do not affect blood sugar levels as much as regular sugar does; third they contain no fat which makes them ideal for diets where fat intake must be limited; fourth they come in various forms so you can use them in place of regular sugar when cooking without having any noticeable difference in taste or texture; fifth they are available in both liquid form as well as powder form so they can easily be added into drinks; sixth they have no aftertaste so they won't leave an unpleasant lingering flavor behind; seventh they can help reduce cravings for sweets by providing an alternative sweetener that doesn't cause tooth decay or cavities; eighth they often come in smaller packages making them more economical than traditional sugar; ninth they are often used as an ingredient in many foods and beverages making them more versatile than regular sugar; finally lastly many people prefer using these substitutes because they believe that they are better for their health than regular table sugar due to their lack of additives or preservatives found in most commercially produced products containing regular table sugar.\nAll together these substitutes offer numerous benefits which make them attractive options when compared against regular table sugar - especially when considering long term health effects related to diet selection."

While a psychopath will often show no remorse or guilt when hurting other people, an psychopath will usually have some level of awareness about their own actions and will feel guilty if they get caught.  psychopath  on the other hand is someone who has been diagnosed with antisocial disorder which means that they lack empathy for others and tend to act selfishly without regard for others feelings.  psychopath  also tends to display more extreme forms of aggression than normal people do; for example they may become violent when provoked rather than just reacting emotionally as most healthy individuals would do .  psychopath  is also characterized by being highly manipulative and deceitful - this can make it very difficult for them to maintain relationships since others often find it hard not trust such an unpredictable person .  psychopath  also tends to have difficulty regulating their emotions - often becoming angry easily due either lack of understanding why certain things happened or simply because they don't understand what makes them feel angry at all .  psychopath  also tends towards being very impulsive and reckless when taking risks ; they may take big risks without thinking about potential consequences which can lead to serious problems both professionally as well socially .

They play a role in pollination and help spread seeds, as well as being food for other animals such as birds and fish. Additionally, some mosquitoes are actually beneficial in helping control certain types of pests and insects. \n\nIt may seem logical to try and get rid of all mosquitoes, but this could have serious consequences on the environment. For example, if you were to completely eradicate mosquitoes, it could lead to an overpopulation of their prey such as birds or bats. This could cause an imbalance in nature which could ultimately harm the entire ecosystem."

What did Hulu do to get around adblock and why does n't every site just do it ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Hulu defeated AdBlock by implementing a system of tracking cookies that would allow them to identify users who were blocking their ads. They also used a technology called \"paywall\" which requires users to pay in order to access content without ads. This made it difficult for AdBlock users to see any ads on the site. 2.\nHulu also implemented a system where they would show videos with embedded ads at random intervals throughout the content. This helped them circumvent AdBlock users as well since these videos could not be blocked by an AdBlock extension."

You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nHow does the moon 's gravitational pull have such a strong effect on the incredibly heavy and massive ocean , while it has no visible effect on a glass of water ? Or a small pond even . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe moon's gravity is stronger than the Earth's gravity because it is much closer to us. It is also much bigger than the Earth, so it has more mass. This means that the moon has a greater gravitational pull on the Earth and its oceans than the Earth has on itself or other objects near it. The oceans are affected by this pull because they are made up of lots of water molecules, which are attracted to the moon. The effect of the moon's gravity on the oceans is similar to how you might feel if you were standing on a trampoline and someone else jumped onto it - your feet would sink into the trampoline a bit because the person jumping on it is exerting an extra force. Similarly, the moon's gravity causes the oceans to bulge out in certain places where it pulls them in different directions. This is why we can see higher tides when the moon is full or new - these are times when the moon is closest to the Earth and its gravitational pull is strongest."

I 've heard before this has to do with the anaesthesia not working properly but would like a more thorough answer Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nHaving an empty stomach before an operation is important because it helps ensure that the anaesthesia will work properly and safely. When a person is given anaesthesia, their body needs time to process it so they can relax and sleep during the procedure. If there is food in the stomach, it could interfere with this process and make it harder for the anaesthesia to take effect. Additionally, if there is too much gas or liquid in the stomach, it could cause discomfort during the operation or even lead to complications such as choking. Therefore, it's always best to clear out any food from your stomach before undergoing surgery!"

How do they use that to figure what / how they are going to build ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n When we look at the tripod, we see that it has two arms and a base. The arms hold up the camera while the base holds it steady on the ground. This is important because it allows the surveyor to take accurate measurements without any shaking or wobbling.  Also, we can see that there is a small hole in one arm of the tripod where the measuring tape will be placed later on . This is also important as it allows for precise readings from the measuring tape when taking measurements ."

What is the brains point in doing this ( like is it protecting itself ) ? Are some people more likely for this to happen ? Or will everyone eventually have one if put through enough stress ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Extreme stress can cause a psychotic episode because when we feel overwhelmed and stressed out, our brain releases chemicals that help us cope with the situation. These chemicals, called neurotransmitters, are usually released in small amounts but during times of extreme stress they can be released in large quantities. When this happens, it can cause an imbalance in the way the brain functions which can lead to symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations or delusions.\n \nSome people may be more likely to experience a psychotic episode due to factors such as genetics or past traumas; however, anyone can potentially have one if they are exposed to enough stress over an extended period of time. In order for this type of event to occur, there must be something else triggering it - such as a traumatic event or a sudden change in life circumstances - that causes the brain's chemical balance to shift in a way that leads to these symptoms appearing.\n \nIf you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, it’s important to seek professional help from a mental health expert who can provide appropriate treatment options tailored specifically for your needs!"

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n, Communism is an ideology that advocates for the ownership of all property and resources by the government, with no private ownership allowed. Socialism is similar to Communism in that it also supports the idea that all property should be owned collectively by the people or the state. However, unlike Communism socialism does not necessarily require complete state control over economic activities; instead it allows for some degree of private enterprise while still maintaining collective ownership of key industries such as energy production and transportation systems. Finally, fascism refers to political movements which advocate strong central authority and a strong military presence combined with anti-communist sentiment. It often involves authoritarian rule over citizens’ lives through censorship of free speech, press freedom, religious practices etc.."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nIt is not easy for Mexicans to cross the border legally because the United States has very strict immigration laws. They must go through an extensive process of applying for and obtaining visas and documentation in order to enter the country legally. Additionally, there are often long waits and waiting lists for these visas and documents, which can take years. Furthermore, many people choose to cross the border illegally because they believe that it will be easier than trying to follow all the rules and regulations set forth by the government."

It also has great properties for keeping the road smooth and preventing water from seeping into the ground. Asphalt doesn't break as easily as other materials, making it better at preventing potholes. The only downside is that it does wear down over time, but this is just part of the normal aging process of any road material."

Clindamycin is effective against many types of bacteria that may cause infections in your mouth. It's also less likely to cause side effects than Penamox. As for when you'll start seeing signs of improvement, it depends on the severity of the infection and how well your body responds to treatment. You should start noticing some relief within one to three days."

When you go half the speed of light in one direction, it means that you're moving 1/2 c (half the speed of light). Similarly, when the other body moves half the speed of light in the opposite direction, it also means that they are moving 1/2 c in the opposite direction. So, even though you are both traveling at half the speed of light, you are not moving at the speed of light relative to each other because your paths are crossing at right angles and therefore cancel out."

What genes were on that branch that is missing in guys ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X chromosome and contains many fewer genes.  This means that males do not have all of the same genetic information as females.  For example, males do not have the gene for producing estrogen which allows them to grow pubic hair and have a deeper voice.  Males also do not have the gene for producing certain types of sex hormones such as testosterone or estrogen which give them different physical characteristics compared to females."

It always boggled my mind when they display the epic sized numbers when describing distances and size of space things ... Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Astronomers use special tools called telescopes to look at the stars, planets, and other space things. They measure the brightness of each thing and use this information to figure out how far away it is from Earth.  We also use something called \"parallax\" which means that if we look at an object from two different places at the same time we can see how much closer or farther it appears to be.  This helps us understand how big or small objects in space actually are .  We can also measure distances between objects by comparing their sizes - for example, if one star looks bigger than another one then it must be further away from us than the other one ."

There were all sorts of bugs and other creatures that could make us sick if we didn't have the right defenses in place. So over time our bodies developed ways of protecting us from these nasties - but sometimes this protection went too far and started attacking our own cells instead!  These are what we call allergies. \n\n  As for whether or not humanity is stupid at evolving - nope! We've come so far already but there's still much more to learn about ourselves! And yes there are definitely some benefits from having allergies - like helping our immune system stay strong which can be useful against other illnesses down the line."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nThe 2nd Amendment is a tricky one because it was written in a time when guns were not as powerful as they are today. It's also written in words that can be interpreted in many different ways. Some people think it means everyone has the right to own guns while others think it only applies to certain types of weapons or to certain groups of people. The framers didn't have much experience with guns and didn't want to make any rules about them, so they used vague language instead.

The symptoms may be similar to those caused by a bug bite, but it is difficult to tell without examining the area. Your doctor's prescription for penicillin may not help in this case as it is typically used to treat bacterial infections.

The message for laughing tells your body to make funny noises, while the message for masturbation tells your body to move certain parts of your body in order to reach an orgasm."

When you do this, all the characters, objects and events in the game will be frozen and won't move anymore.

The game is paused so you can look at things more closely or do other things without having to wait until the action continues again."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nCISPA (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act) is a type of legislation that was originally introduced in 2010 to allow the government to share information about cyber threats. It was intended to provide greater security for American citizens online, but it was never fully implemented due to opposition from privacy advocates. In order to get around this opposition, proponents of CISPA have rebranded it as \"The Cyber Intelligence Improvement and Protection Act\" or \"CIPA\" which has been reintroduced multiple times without any significant changes since 2010. The bill has been designed so that if it fails once it can simply be renamed and tried again with slight modifications until it finally passes."

I used to experience guilty and disgusted feelings after masturbating , and I 've heard from others that they 've experienced the same . Why does this happen to some people ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n This happens because when you have an orgasm, your body releases a hormone called oxytocin which can make you feel happy and satisfied. However, if you feel guilty or disgusted afterwards it may be because you don't want anyone else to know what you did, or you're worried about getting caught. It's also possible that you may not fully connect with your body's natural pleasure responses and instead focus on negative thoughts or feelings."

So when someone asks you something like \"what time is dinner?\" or \"can I have some more ice cream?\", you'll hear them say it in this special way that sounds very unique to us."

But actually, most spiders don't even want to bite you - they just feel threatened when they see a human around their web!  Spiders have evolved over time so that they can recognize potential threats such as predators or humans who might eat their food sources (like other insects ). If the spider thinks something is dangerous then it will try its best not be noticed so it doesn't get eaten !  So basically all spiders are trying hard not get eaten ; however some people still think spiders are gross and scary!"

I 'm not talking about hospital scenarios but say someone dies from like drowning or choking , Why ca n't we revive them ? Also , what 's the point in freezing bodies ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nYes, it is physically possible to bring a dead body back to life. This is known as resuscitation and can be done through artificial means such as CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) or medical procedures that restore the heart and breathing functions. It can also be done naturally through natural processes such as the body’s own healing mechanisms. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that there are limits to how much of a person’s life can be restored once they have died. There is no guarantee that a person who has been revived will regain all of their abilities and memories, and some people may never fully recover. Additionally, the process of bringing someone back to life can be very difficult on both the patient and those who are helping them. \n\nAs for why we freeze bodies, it is because freezing slows down biological processes such as decomposition which allows for longer preservation of remains without them deteriorating too quickly. This allows scientists and researchers to study bodies more easily over time in order to learn more about human anatomy and physiology."

I think it 's partly to do with copyright issues but that 's all I know . Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n DRM stands for Digital Rights Management and is used to restrict the use of copyrighted material on digital devices. It's a type of software that limits how you can use or copy files or software. DRM-free means that the file or software can be copied, modified and shared without any restrictions. People prefer DRM-free versions because they don't want their work restricted in any way, especially when it comes to sharing and distributing content online."

You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nBabyfood jar VS real food discoloration Explain to me why a jar of banana baby food does not insta - turns brown just like a real life banana ? The jar states nothing is added ... Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n A baby food jar is made with a special kind of plastic that prevents the food from changing color.  It also has a lid that seals tightly so no air can get in and cause the food to turn brown.  Real bananas, on the other hand, contain a natural chemical called anthocyanin which causes them to change color when exposed to heat or light."

These estimates are derived from data collected through surveys and interviews with victims, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders. The UNODC also takes into account various factors such as the size of the population affected by the industry, the number of people engaged in it, and how much money it generates. While these numbers may not be exact, they provide a general idea of how much money is made from this type of illegal activity globally."

This is very simple and we see examples of it all the time with ants , human weightlifting , etc . but it would be great to hear some different ways of explaining it . Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n \nWhen an organism lifts something heavier than its own body weight, it uses a combination of muscles and gravity. The muscles in the organism's body work together to generate force which helps them lift the object. At the same time, gravity is working against them, trying to pull the object back down. By using their muscles in conjunction with gravity, the organism is able to overcome the force of gravity and lift the object."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nNo two snowflakes are alike because of the way they form. Snowflakes form in clouds when supercooled water droplets freeze into ice crystals. As these ice crystals grow, they take on different shapes depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment. The unique shape of each snowflake depends on its formation environment - temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction - as well as the chemical composition of the air around it. Because all of these factors vary from place to place, no two snowflakes can ever be identical."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n In the animal kingdom, males often have larger bodies than females and are more likely to be aggressive when competing for mates. This means that females need to find ways to ensure their survival while also reproducing. One way they can do this is by having a shorter reproductive period - meaning they can give birth sooner after mating. This allows them more time to raise their young before another competitor comes along."

They can be caused by human error, such as forgetting to close a parenthesis or not following proper coding standards, or they can be due to design flaws or logic errors within the program itself. The difficulty of creating bug-free code comes from the fact that there are often many different ways to write a piece of code, and it's hard to predict all possible scenarios where something might go wrong. Additionally, some complex problems may require advanced mathematical algorithms which could lead to unforeseen results if not coded correctly."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nP.E.M.D.A.S. is the order in which mathematical operations should be performed. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. In other words, when solving an equation, you should always do the operation inside parentheses first, then any exponents or powers, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. \nIf people in an alternate universe used S.A.D.M.E.P., they would do their operations in reverse order: Parentheses, Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication and Division, Exponents and Powers. This means that if you were asked to solve 3 + 2 x 4 - 1, you would start by adding 3 and 2, then multiply that result by 4 and subtract 1 from it. The result would be different from what we get with P.E.M.D.A.S., since the order of operations is reversed."

Common causes include muscle strain or sprain, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, arthritis, osteoporosis, and degenerative disc disease. Additionally, conditions such as sciatica, pinched nerves, and tendinitis can also lead to these types of pain. In your case, it's important to rule out any underlying medical issues that may be contributing to your symptoms, so you should see a doctor for an evaluation."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nNo, power plants don't store power like batteries or capacitors. Instead, they release the electricity into the electrical grid which is then distributed to homes and businesses. The amount of electricity generated at each plant is based on demand, so if there's more demand for electricity than the plant can produce, it will have to reduce its output until the demand decreases. If there isn't enough demand for electricity, some of it may be stored in batteries or pumped hydroelectric systems for later use."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nPostal Service is in severe debt because it has too many employees, outdated equipment, and an aging workforce. In order to save money, the government has been making cuts to the Postal Service's budget. These cuts have helped reduce the amount of money the Post Office needs to spend on things like salaries and benefits for its workers. However, there is still a large amount of money that the Post Office needs to cover its expenses and keep running. The best way to resolve this issue would be for Congress to increase funding or look into ways to make the Postal Service more efficient."

For example, Google knows how to look for websites that have been updated recently, or that have new information that people might want to see. It also knows which sites have the best content and which ones should be shown first when someone types in a word or phrase into their search bar. Plus, Google has a really good way of deciding which links lead back to pages with useful information - it looks at how many other people have linked to them before - so it can show users the pages they're most likely interested in seeing first."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n because they're made from recycled paper which helps reduce waste and pollution . The bottles themselves also help conserve water as they are reusable and don't need to be constantly replaced like plastic bottles do . Also when people buy drinks in cans they tend not to drink all of their contents so there's less food waste compared with bottles which often get thrown away after just one use . Lastly but certainly not least important is that glass containers can be easily cleaned without any chemicals needed which makes them safer for both consumers and producers alike .

Why ca n't normal AA or other battery be recharged ? Edit : Answered ! Thank you ! Some great analogies used here ! ! Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nA rechargeable battery is made of two electrodes with different materials and a liquid called an electrolyte in between them. When the battery is charged, electricity flows through the electrodes to create chemical reactions that produce energy. This energy can then be used to power devices. Normal AA batteries do not have this feature because they use only one type of material as an electrode and don't have an electrolyte. Therefore, they cannot be recharged."

Why do most US Universities opt to use the 4 - point GPA System rather than percentage grades ? Edit : Thanks for all your help ! Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nGPA stands for Grade Point Average and is a way to measure how well you did in school.  GPA uses a scale of 0 to 4 where 4 is the highest possible score.  This allows colleges and universities to compare students' academic performance on a consistent basis. \n  It also helps them decide which students they want to accept into their programs.  Most U.S. universities use this system because it gives an objective measure of a student's academic ability that can be used by both students and schools when making decisions about admissions or scholarships ."

We've always been committed to providing high quality products at affordable prices and one way we do this is by using cost effective manufacturing techniques such as using small speaker components when they could be replaced with larger more expensive ones.  However there are certain situations where it makes sense to use smaller speakers instead of larger ones - for example if the application requires precise control over volume levels or if space is limited then smaller speakers may provide better performance than larger ones due to their ability to focus sound waves more efficiently .  This is why many of our products come equipped with both large and small speakers - so customers can choose which one best suits their needs!"

It is a complex network of thoughts, emotions, memories and beliefs that are all influenced by the neurochemical reactions in the brain. The mind can be thought of as an extension of the brain that allows us to experience our world in a conscious way. While the mind is certainly influenced by the brain, it also has its own unique qualities and functions which cannot be reduced down to just biological processes.

It says that all matter in the universe can be made from tiny strings that vibrate at different frequencies.  super symmetry is another theory that suggests particles with opposite charges should have similar properties. This means that if one particle has a certain type of charge, then its anti-particle will also have the same type of charge but with the opposite sign.

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nSometimes, teams will choose a quarterback from college who is very hyped but may not be ready for the professional level yet. They may also want to give their other quarterbacks more playing time before bringing in a new one. In these cases, it's likely that the team will let the new quarterback sit on the bench until he is ready for his first start. It's also possible that the coach might be trying out different players to see which one performs best - this is called \"quarterbacking rotation\" - so he could end up starting someone else instead of the newly drafted player."

It is best to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider so they can determine whether further testing or treatment is needed. They may also want to review any medications you are currently taking in order to rule out any potential interactions with those medications."

That would be too much money , but if you buy two of them then it ' s still too much money ! So why not buy three of them ? 16 GB micro SD card + 3 x 16 GB micro SD cards = 48 GB of storage . So instead of paying 10 dollars for each micro SD card , pay only 10 dollars for all three cards combined ! "

If someone is on death row , it 's often years before they are killed . Why does the process take so long ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n people on death row have to wait a very long time before they can be killed because there are lots of rules and procedures that must be followed. It takes a long time for the courts to make decisions about whether or not someone should be executed and what method of execution will be used. In addition, the government has to ensure that all of the legal requirements have been met before anyone can actually be put to death. So even though people may have been convicted of committing a crime, it still takes a lot of time for them to face justice."

How does the linear speed in one direction alter the weight distribution in another ? Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n it's easier to balance yourself on a fast moving bicycle rather than a slow one because the faster moving bicycle has more momentum. Momentum is how fast something is moving and it depends on its mass (how heavy it is) and its velocity (how quickly it's moving). When you ride a fast moving bicycle, your body moves with it and therefore you're less likely to fall off! \n \nLinear speed in one direction also alters the weight distribution in another because when you move forward in one direction your center of gravity shifts towards that side; this means that your legs have to work harder to keep up with your arms which are still moving backward from where they were before!  As such, your body becomes unbalanced and it's harder for you to stay upright!"

This pedal is connected to a metal piece inside the car that has lots of small metal rods coming out of it. These rods connect to the gears in the back of the car, allowing them to spin when you want them to shift into different gears so that you can move faster or slower depending on what you want. When you release the clutch pedal, it allows those metal rods to move freely so they don't get stuck when shifting between gears."

Additionally , many countries that have adopted socialist policies have seen significant economic growth and development over time .

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nIt's because 25th December is the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, which is when the days start getting longer again after the shortest day of the year. This made it a significant date for many ancient cultures who worshipped the sun god as well as for Christians who believe that Jesus was born on this day. Therefore, many different holidays and celebrations have been established around this time to honor the returning light of the sun or to remember the birth of Christ."

The pain may be due to the fatty liver itself or it could be related to other factors such as gastritis or gallstones. In order to determine the cause of your pain, you should undergo an abdominal ultrasound examination. This will help your doctor determine the exact cause of your pain and provide appropriate treatment.\n\nIn terms of medication, silbostin is used for treating symptoms associated with fatty liver disease such as pain and discomfort. It may also help improve overall liver function. BP tablets can help lower high blood pressure which may be contributing to your pain. It is important to follow up with your doctor regularly so that they can monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments in treatment."

Can someone help me?\nassistant\nIt is likely that your ribs are simply inflamed due to overuse or injury. In order to treat this type of pain, you should try taking anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen. You may also want to apply ice packs to the affected area several times per day for up to 20 minutes each time. Additionally, you should try taking deep breaths and doing gentle stretches in order to ease any discomfort that may be caused by breathing deeply. If the pain persists, it would be best to consult a doctor for further evaluation and treatment options."

He may be experiencing emotional distress or frustration, which can lead to anger outbursts. It is also possible that his behavior is related to physical conditions such as a stroke or other neurological disorder. It would be best for you to consult with a medical professional who can help diagnose and treat any potential health issues. Additionally, it may be beneficial for him to seek counseling from a therapist who can help address any underlying psychological issues that could be contributing to his anger outbursts. Finally, it is important that both parties communicate openly about their feelings and work together towards finding solutions that will help both of you manage these difficult situations effectively."

I realise that groceries and that sorta thing gets contaminated , but why is alcoholic beverages and Liquor is thrown out aswell , even though some of it was nt close to the fire ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n It's because when something catches fire, it becomes unsafe to consume or use. That includes alcohol and other drinks. Even if the fire wasn't right next to the alcohol itself, any liquids in the store could have been affected by smoke from the fire and would be considered unsafe for consumption. Therefore, it's important to throw away all items in the store that might have been exposed to smoke from the fire in order to ensure customer safety."

So it's kind of like how you might want to test out different flavors of ice cream on people and see which one they like best- so in this case your dependent variable would be people's taste in ice cream while your independent variable would be what flavor is being tested (like chocolate vs vanilla)."

I know we ’re living things and cellular components are different from electrical components , but what is it about cameras that prevents the damage ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Well, when you look at the sun with your naked eye or through something else like binoculars or a telescope, you can cause permanent damage to your vision because the light coming from the sun is so strong. However, when you use a camera to take pictures of the sun, the lens inside the camera protects it from this harmful radiation by blocking it before it enters the sensor. So even though taking pictures of the sun might seem risky, it won't actually damage the camera itself since there's no direct exposure of its sensitive parts."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Car alarms are made up of simple electronic components and don't have a lot of moving parts. So when they go off, they only produce two types of sounds: the beeping noise which signals an alarm has been triggered, and the continuous tone which lets you know how long ago it was activated. The continuous tone can vary in length depending on how long ago the alarm went off - sometimes it's short and sharp while other times it lasts for several seconds."

In this case, since your menstrual cycle is irregular, it is possible that you ovulated earlier than expected which could have caused you to become pregnant. It is recommended to take a pregnancy test or consult with a healthcare professional for further guidance."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nYour friend's eyes water when he drinks a fizzy drink because the gas in the drink is making his eyes feel uncomfortable and irritated. The fizzy drink is filled with carbon dioxide, which can be very irritating to the eyes. As soon as your friend takes his first sip of the drink, it causes a reaction in his eye that makes them feel like they're watering. After that initial reaction, the rest of the drink doesn't cause any more irritation and so his eyes don't continue to water."

Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nCSI uses a variety of methods to determine the time of death. They look at things such as the body's temperature, the rate of decomposition, and any evidence left behind, like blood or saliva. The temperature of the body will gradually decrease after death due to heat loss from the body and the surrounding environment. This temperature change helps them figure out when death occurred. They also look for signs of decomposition which includes the breakdown of proteins in the body, which starts immediately after death. Finally, they examine any evidence left behind on the victim such as blood or saliva to determine how long ago they were alive. All these clues help them figure out the time of death without any witnesses or anyone else who saw them die."

Depending on the situation, this could be probation, community service or even jail time. If it is determined that they are highly likely to reoffend, they may not be eligible for release into the public until certain conditions are met such as completing treatment programs or having no further contact with other sex offenders.

Edit : Thank you everyone who replied ! Please explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nIf you think about it, each point in a line has no volume because it's just a single point with no length or width. When you take multiple points and connect them to form a line, the line itself still doesn't have any volume because it is still just one dimensional (length). The same thing applies for planes and 3D objects. Each plane is two-dimensional (width and height) but has no thickness, so it doesn't have any volume either. Finally, a 3D object is three-dimensional (length, width, and height), but all of these dimensions add up to give the object its total volume. So even though individual points don't have any volume, when combined they create objects that do have volume!"

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n Back in the day, when people used to carry around paper money and coins, it was easy to steal their money. That's why they invented credit cards with magnetic stripes. The magnetic stripe stored information about the cardholder's account number and other personal details that could be read by machines when swiped through a reader. \n\nNowadays though, most stores accept Chip & Pin (also known as contactless payment), which is much more secure than using a magnetic stripe. With this technology, customers can make payments simply by tapping their card near an electronic terminal without needing to insert or swipe it into a machine - making life easier for both customers and retailers alike!"

However , there is growing evidence that this system is not ideal for all students . A year-round calendar would provide more consistent school days throughout the year which can help reduce student absences due to weather related issues or other disruptions .

They might also think that denying climate change is the only way to protect their jobs and industries, or that it's easier to ignore the problem than to try and solve it. Additionally, some people may not have enough information about the topic and thus cannot make an informed decision on whether climate change exists or not. Ultimately, there must be something of value in denying climate change for people to continue with this line of thinking despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary."

Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWhen dinosaurs roamed the earth, there were many species that were bipedal (meaning they could walk on two legs) and were strictly land-based. However, when the dinosaurs went extinct millions of years ago, the world's climate changed and it became much harder for bipedal animals to survive. This led to a decline in their population and eventually resulted in only some mammals and a handful of birds being able to live as strictly bipedal animals today."

Since then my arm aches constantly but its from the wrist up and moved into my shoulder. Im also very tired lately too\nassistant\nThe most common cause of elbow and arm pain is repetitive strain or overuse, which can be caused by activities such as typing or playing sports. The best remedy would be to rest your arm, ice it, take anti-inflammatory medication and use a compression bandage. Additionally, stretching exercises and physiotherapy may help to alleviate the pain."

Me personally roll around a lot while sleeping and do crazy kicks and what not but I seem to never fall out of bed . Are we concious about our surroundings as we 're asleep ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\nWe stop rolling out of bed while we sleep because our body has an automatic reflex called the \"sleeping reflex\". This reflex causes our muscles to relax and slow down our movements, which helps us stay in bed. We don't really think about our surroundings when we're asleep, but our brain is still aware of them - it just doesn't send signals to our muscles to move."

But I just experienced the worst turbulence of my life in visually perfectly clear weather . What gives ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n turbulence means that there is some movement or change in the air around you, such as when you see the clouds moving or hear the thunder. It can happen even when the sky looks like it has nothing to move about .  But sometimes there can be turbulence without any reason at all - like when you try to fly through an open window but your feet stick to the floor! That's why we call it \"turbulence\" - because it causes things to move around unexpectedly."

My girlfriend and I are having a baby and she is rhesus negative , I 'm confused as fuck , can you please explain ? Explain like I'm five.\nassistant\n incompatibility during pregnancy means that your blood type is different from your partner's blood type. When this happens, the baby's red blood cells may not be able to survive in your body because they will be recognized as foreign by your immune system. This can cause serious health problems for both you and your baby if left untreated ."
