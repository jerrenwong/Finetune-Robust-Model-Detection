    "question": "Why do helicopter blades make the choppy sound they do when they are spinning around at a constant speed ? If they are turning at the same rate , should n't they just make sort of a buzzing sound and not a pulsing sound ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "When helicopter blades spin around at a constant speed, they create turbulence in the air that makes a choppy sound. The turbulence is caused by the blades pushing against each other and creating eddies of air that move back and forth. These eddies of air are what make the sound that you hear as the helicopter flies by. \n\nThe reason why this sound is described as \"choppy\" is because it is not a continuous sound, but rather a series of short bursts of noise. This is because the blades are constantly changing their position relative to the airflow, causing the eddies to form in different places every time they rotate. As a result, the sound is not uniform and has a choppy quality to it."

    "response": "Statistics about unreported crimes are usually collected through surveys and interviews with victims. Victims are asked if they reported their crime to law enforcement, and if not, why not. The responses from these surveys are then used to create an estimate of how many crimes go unreported. These estimates can be used to help inform policy decisions and improve public safety."

    "response": "Sports stadiums are usually funded by a combination of public and private sources. The taxpayer money comes from general revenue and can include funds from lottery tickets or sales tax revenues. The business side of things, such as the NFL, is responsible for operating and maintaining the stadium after it has been built. However, because stadiums are so large and costly to build, there is often not enough money in the budget to cover all costs. This is why taxpayers are asked to front the bill for sports stadiums."

    "question": "Why do n't professional basketball players backboard alley - oop to themselves in - game more ? Specifically in the half - court : URL_0 EDIT : Clarification Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Professional basketball players don't backboard alley-oop to themselves in-game because it would be considered a violation of the rules. Backboarding is only allowed when an opposing player is shooting or attempting to shoot a free throw and the ball goes out of bounds. The player can then backboard the ball back into play with their own hand. In half-court situations, there's no reason for the player to backboard an alley-oop since they're already within reach of the basket."

    "question": "What happens in the brain of a schizophrenic ? How is it different to a \" normal \" brain ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The brain of a person with schizophrenia has some differences compared to a \"normal\" brain. In particular, there are often changes in the way that certain parts of the brain communicate with one another. For example, the communication between areas responsible for thinking and planning (the prefrontal cortex) may be impaired in someone with schizophrenia. This can lead to problems with organizing thoughts and making decisions. \n\nIn addition, there may also be differences in how certain chemicals in the brain work. Chemical messengers called neurotransmitters are responsible for transmitting signals between neurons in the brain. In people with schizophrenia, there may be too much or too little of these messengers, which could affect how well messages get across from one part of the brain to another.\n\nOverall, these changes in the way that certain parts of the brain communicate with one another and how certain chemicals function may contribute to some of the symptoms experienced by individuals with schizophrenia."

The more significant figures there are in the measurement, the more precise it is. For example, if you measure a cup of water and get 200 milliliters (ml) with two significant figures, then that means the actual volume of the water could be anywhere between 195 ml and 205 ml. If you measure the same cup of water with four significant figures and get 200. 13 ml then that means the actual volume of the water must be closer to 200. 13 ml."

    "response": "Two-way glass works by having two layers of glass with a thin film of silver in between them. The silver is coated on the outside surface of each layer of glass and acts as a mirror. When light enters the glass from one side, it bounces off the silver layer and comes out the other side. When light enters from the opposite direction, it reflects off the first layer's silver coating and gets reflected back again before coming out the second layer's silver coating. So only light that enters from one side can pass through to the other side; light entering from the opposite direction will be reflected back out."

The music is not physically stored on the device itself; instead, it is represented digitally as a series of 0's and 1's which are read by the iPod's processor and converted back into sound waves for playback. This allows for easy storage, transfer and playback of large amounts of music without requiring any physical medium such as a CD or vinyl record."

    "response": "1080i and 1080p are two different types of high definition video resolutions . In simple terms, 1080i means that each frame of the video is scanned twice (interlaced) while 1080p means that every frame of the video is captured in one go (progressive). 1080i provides smoother motion than 1080p but it has less detail because only half of each frame is captured in one pass while 1080p captures all frames in one go resulting in higher quality picture with more details . 1080i is generally considered good enough for most people who watch videos on TVs or computers as it offers better viewing experience than standard def which does not have any interlacing . 1080p is better if you want to watch movies with higher quality pictures without any visible judder from motion ; however this comes at higher cost since it requires more processing power from your device . 1080p will look sharper and more detailed compared to 1080i when viewed on a large screen such as a home theater system .  Both formats are widely used nowadays especially when watching videos online on devices like laptops , tablets or smartphones ."

The embryo grows bigger and stronger until it's ready to come out. When it gets ready, it starts making tiny holes in the shell with its muscles so that water can get in. This makes the shell become soft and pliable. Then, as soon as the baby animal is born, it uses its head to crack open the egg!"

Calibre refers to the diameter of the bullet in millimeters or inches, while mm is just a unit for measuring length. So, a 9 mm round shot from an M9 would have a calibre of 9 mm. It's not possible to interchange these descriptions because they refer to two different things - the size of the bullet versus how it's measured."

When they get close enough together though, they start ticking in sync with one another and thus their periods come around at about the same time every month ."

    "question": "Why is asphalt black ? Would Concrete or another material not work better ? Does the asphalt not make the surrounding area hotter ? I have always wondered why we do n't use concrete or change the color of asphalt or something else . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "long time ago, when the first roads were built, people wanted to make them look nice and shiny so they used black colored tar to coat the roads.  This tar was made from a substance called bitumen which is extracted from oil wells.  The tar turned out to be very good at keeping cars and trucks from slipping on the road, so it became popular for road construction.  As time went on more and more people began using black colored tar to make their own roads.  Today most roads in the world are covered with asphalt (which is just another name for black colored tar) because it works well as a road surface material and has become very popular among engineers who design roads.  Asphalt makes roads cooler than other materials because it absorbs less heat than concrete or other dark colored materials such as dark colored asphalt."

When something goes wrong with our digestive system and we feel sick, our brain sends signals to our body telling it to get rid of whatever is making us feel bad. This process is called vomiting. The Vomiting Reflex can be triggered by anything from eating too much food to having an upset stomach from something you ate. But even when no one else is vomiting around you, you might still find yourself feeling ill enough to throw up yourself just because you saw others do it! It's just how our bodies work."

    "response": "soreness in the rib cage region can be caused by several factors including injury, strain or overuse of the muscles, inflammation from an infection or other illness, or even an underlying medical condition such as a herniated disc or rib fracture. The sharp pain you describe could indicate that your body is reacting to something irritating nearby, such as gas in your digestive tract or trapped air in your lungs. It's best to see a doctor if this discomfort persists for more than a few days so they can help determine what is causing it and how best to treat it."

    "response": "The Wingdings font is a typeface that was created to provide designers with an additional set of icons and symbols for their work. It includes over 200 different characters that can be used in place of letters or numbers. While it may look fun and playful, there are actually many practical applications for this font. For example, graphic designers can use Wingdings to add visual interest and emphasis to their designs. In addition, Wingdings can also be used as a substitute for certain words when creating more visually interesting content such as newsletters or presentations. Lastly, some people find Wingdings useful because it allows them to create unique text effects without having access to advanced design software."

    "question": "Can someone please explain to me how WiFi works LI5 ? How does it work ? How can something be transmitted without wires ? How do computers receive WiFi signals ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "WiFi is an technology that allows devices such as computers, smartphones and tablets to connect with each other over a network without the use of physical wires or cables .  For example , when you connect your computer to a WiFi network via its Wi-Fi card , it sends out radio waves in order to establish a connection with the router which is located somewhere nearby .  These radio waves contain information about the device trying to connect such as its IP address , username , password etc .  Once the router receives these packets , it uses some complex algorithms (like encryption) in order to verify if the incoming packet belongs to the correct user before forwarding it further on down the line until it reaches the destination machine where it can be processed by whatever software applications are running on there ."

This language is called a programming language and it tells the robot what actions to take. For example, if you tell your robot to move forward one step, then it will physically move its wheels and go forward. Similarly, if you tell it to pick up an object with its arms, then it will physically use its motors and grippers to pick up whatever you're telling it to pick up. So basically, the programming language gives instructions for the machine to follow which result in physical actions."

    "response": "Earwax is a natural substance that forms in the ear canal. It is made up of keratin (a type of protein), lanolin (a waxy substance), and other substances. The main function of earwax is to protect the ear canal from infection and debris. More earwax can be a sign of an underlying medical condition such as eczema or psoriasis. Some people produce more earwax than others due to genetics or environmental factors such as humidity levels. In order to reduce the amount of earwax produced, it's best to use over-the-counter products such as drops or sprays that contain ingredients like alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, using cotton swabs regularly may help remove excess earwax without causing damage to the delicate skin inside the ear canal."

    "response": "It's just the way humans were born and raised. We have to learn everything from scratch because we're not born knowing how to do anything. Other animals come out of their mother's wombs already knowing how to hunt or be aggressive - it's nature! But humans have to work really hard at learning things and getting better at them over time - it takes practice! That's why we aren't as good at some things as other animals right away - it takes time for us to develop our skills."

    "response": "class is a blueprint for creating objects while an object is an instance of a class . In order to create an object you must first define its class which will specify what attributes it has (i.e what properties it has ) as well as the methods that can be called on that object (i.e what operations can be performed on the object ). Once defined , you can then instantiate your class by calling its constructor method which creates an object from the class definition . The syntax used to define classes looks like this: class ClassName(object):  def __init__(self, arg1, arg2,... ):    self.arg1 = arg1    self.arg2 = arg2... # other code goes here\n# end of class definition\ndef someMethod(self):    # implementation of some method goes here\n  # end of method definition\nclass AnotherClass(object):\n   def anotherMethod(self):\n      # implementation of another method goes here\n  # end of method definition\nobjectName = ClassName(arg1, arg2,... )\n# instantiation of class\nobjectName.someMethod() \n# call someMethod on instantiated object\nAnotherObject = AnotherClass()\nAnotherObject.anotherMethod()\n# call anotherMethod on instantiated object"

    "response": "boat moves through the water by moving its sails and rudder in the right direction. When the wind blows from one side, it pushes the sail towards that direction and creates lift, which helps the boat move forward. The rudder works like an anchor to keep the boat on course when there is no wind.  So when the boat is sailing into the wind (or against the wind), it uses its sails and rudder to create movement in the opposite direction of the wind by pushing itself forward with the help of the wind's force."

    "response": "lot of people think that bikes should be comfy and nice but that's not how they're made. The seat is made of hard plastic or metal so it doesn't move around while you're riding and it gives your bottom a good workout. It also helps keep you upright on the bike which makes pedaling easier and more efficient.  Plus it looks cool when you're cruising down the road!"

    "response": "The old school way of driving is with your hands on the wheel and your feet on the pedals.  It's called manual because you have to manually change gears to move the car forward or reverse.  But these days, many people prefer automatic transmissions which allow them to simply push a button instead of having to manually shift gears.  However, there are some advantages to driving with a manual transmission such as being able to save money on gas since it uses less fuel than an automatic transmission.  Also, some people think that driving with a manual gives them more control over their vehicle and keeps them more focused while driving.  So even though it might be harder to learn at first, there are still benefits to owning a car with a manual transmission."

    "response": "The Holocaust was a series of events that led to the murder of six million Jews and millions more people during World War II. The hatred of Jews had been growing for many years, fueled by anti-Semitic propaganda and discrimination. As a result of this hatred, the Nazis took actions such as restricting Jewish rights, denying them access to education and employment, forcing them to wear special clothing and creating ghettos where they were forced to live. In 1933, Germany began to restrict Jewish people's freedoms and opportunities in an attempt to control their numbers. This led to increased hostility towards them which grew even stronger after the start of World War II in 1939. From 1933 until 1941, Jews faced persecution in Europe as they were stripped of their rights and property while being forced into ghettos and concentration camps."

Similarly, if your friend Taylor was known for being very skinny, but you saw someone else who looked thin and lanky, you might say that person \"doesn't really look like\" Taylor.

Additionally, research suggests that there may be some biological differences between left- and right-handed people that could contribute to a shorter life span."

If you choose to do so, then it is typically the customer who pays for any discounts that are applied to their purchase. In this case, since you received a discount of $0.55 cents off per gallon of gas up to 20 gallons of fuel, it was likely your own money that paid for those discounts when you went to fill up your car with gas.\n\"Thank you for asking me about this - now I know how it works!\" \nThe answer may seem simple but understanding how discounts work can help prevent confusion in future situations where customers receive discounts on products or services."

    "response": "In America, tipping is a form of appreciation for the service provided by bar workers. The amount that people tip varies depending on the situation, but a common practice is to leave one dollar per drink for bar workers. This means that if someone orders three drinks at a bar, they should leave $3 as a tip for the bartender. While this may not seem like a lot of money, it can add up quickly when someone spends time at a bar or goes out with friends regularly. Additionally, tips help ensure that bar workers are compensated fairly for their labor, which helps keep costs down for customers."

After a few minutes, I burped and the pain was gone. Was this indigestion? I also have a herniated disc mid back, although i was sitting at the time. I am worried it could be my heart.",
    "response": "It is possible that your upper back pain and burping may be related to indigestion. However, since you also have a herniated disc in your mid-back, it is important to rule out any potential heart-related issues. If the pain persists or worsens, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. It is important to rule out any serious conditions before dismissing them as indigestion."

    "response": "Because the alcohol affects everyone 's personality differently, it means that when you drink, your personality changes in a way that is different from how other people's personalities change when they drink.  This is because alcohol affects people 's brains in different ways - some people get more relaxed and calm while others become more excited and energetic.  The same thing happens with everyone else - some people get more talkative and loud while others become quieter and more reflective ."

    "response": ", when you cook or microwave vegetables, the heat from doing so causes some of the nutrients to leach out of the vegetable. This is why people often say that cooking vegetables takes away nutrients and vitamins.  In order to keep as many nutrients in your vegetables as possible, it's best to eat them raw whenever you can.  Also, try not to overcook them - this will help prevent any additional nutrient loss from the heat."

    "question": "Timeshares So , are they scams , or can savvy people actually benefit from them ? Who is actually making profit ? Also , what are timeshare presentations exactly ? Basically , what is the deal with those timeshares ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Timeshares are basically when you buy a piece of a vacation property that you can use for a certain amount of time each year. It's kind of like having your own private beach house or cabin on a lake. The difference is that it's not owned outright but rather rented out to others who pay rent for their stay. So technically speaking, the person who owns the property gets paid rent from all of these other folks staying there over the years.\n  •  Who is actually making profit? : In most cases it is the seller (owner) who makes the money since they are able to charge higher prices than regular hotels because they offer unique experiences and amenities such as pools or spa services. However there are some exceptions where buyers make profits too - such as if they purchase an undervalued timeshare at a lower price than its current market value - but this requires research into current timeshare values before purchasing one.\n  • What are timeshare presentations exactly? : Timeshare presentations are simply events where sellers showcase their properties in order to entice potential buyers into buying one. They may include information about features of the property such as pool access, spa services, or other amenities offered at the resort. Some presentations also feature real life stories from happy owners who have enjoyed their stays at various resorts around the world."

    "response": "The law of thermodynamics states that the total amount of energy in the universe cannot change; it can only be converted from one form to another. This means that when you eat food and drink fluids, the energy contained in them must be used up somehow in order to maintain your body's temperature and other functions.  In cases where this energy is not used up (such as when insulin resistance causes excess fat storage), it will be stored as body fat instead of being burned off as energy."

    "response": "A conductor is someone who leads an orchestra or other musical ensemble. They are responsible for directing the musicians, making sure they play in time with each other, and ensuring that the music sounds good. The conductor must have excellent listening skills, as they need to hear all of the instruments playing together and make sure everyone is in sync. In order to do this effectively, the conductor needs to be able to read music quickly and accurately - even faster than the musicians themselves! In addition, conductors must also have strong communication skills in order to instruct players how they want their music to sound without giving away too much detail about specific notes or rhythms. Some people are naturally more talented at conducting than others because of their innate ability to pick up on subtle nuances in pitch and timing which help them direct large groups of people playing complex pieces of music."

    "response": "motion is impossible because the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed - it can only change form.  This means that there is a limit to how much energy can be extracted from a system without creating some other kind of energy in the process (such as heat).  In order for a machine to run on its own power, it would need to somehow violate this law and create more energy than it uses up - but this is not possible."

He s been unconscious since the fall. is there any hope he can come out of this and be the grandfather I remember.",
    "response": "The chances of recovery after a brain hemorrhage depend on many factors such as the size and location of the bleed, the severity of any associated damage, and the speed with which treatment is received. In your grandfather's case, it seems like he has already undergone surgery to relieve the pressure from the bleeding on the left side of his brain. However, given the fact that he has now developed another bleed on the right side of his brain, it would appear unlikely that he will make a full recovery.

    "response": "It's possible that your boyfriend may be experiencing post-coital dysuria, which is a temporary difficulty in urinating after having sexual intercourse. This can be caused by an increase in the pressure on the bladder during sex or by irritation from semen or other substances in the urethra. It usually resolves within a few hours to a day, but if it persists, your boyfriend should see a doctor."

    "response": "New computers don't need to have only USB 3.0 ports because older devices that use slower versions of USB can still connect to them. USB 3.0 ports are backwards compatible with USB 2.0 and even USB 1.1 devices, so there's no need to limit what people can plug into their computer. In addition, adding more USB ports than necessary can save money in the long run - it's cheaper to add extra ports than it is to replace an entire machine if one of those ports gets damaged or stops working."

    "response": "Economic sanctions are put in place to punish countries or groups that do not follow certain rules or laws.  But sometimes these rules and laws can be very complicated, so it is important to make sure that the country or group is truly violating them before imposing any kind of punishment.  In this case, we think that Saudi Arabia may be doing something wrong but we're not entirely sure yet so we need more information before deciding whether or not to impose economic sanctions."

    "response": "Back in the olden days, pants were primarily worn by men as they were more practical for working in fields or factories. Men also wore pants because they were more comfortable than dresses. Skirts were worn by women because they were more fashionable and showed off their bodies. Women also wore skirts to protect their modesty and to cover up their legs. It was believed that wearing pants would make men look too masculine and show off their genitals, which wasn't desirable in those times. On the other hand, wearing skirts gave women an opportunity to display their beauty while still covering up their genitalia."

    "question": "How have Spain and Greece 's unemployment rates gotten so high ? The unemployment rates are as high as some of the poorest places in the world . I ca n't understand why that is happening in developed economies . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Well, basically, when people lose their jobs it means that they don't have any money to spend. When there aren't enough people buying things, companies won't make as much money and will need to lay off more workers. This creates a cycle where fewer people have money to buy things which makes companies even less money and so on.  It's kind of like if you didn't eat dinner one night - then the next day you wouldn't have enough energy to play with your friends anymore because you were too tired from not eating.  So when there isn't enough food for everyone, people start getting sick or becoming lazy because they can't afford medicine or school supplies either. That’s what is happening in Spain and Greece right now – there isn’t enough money around for everyone so everyone suffers."

    "response": "The main reason why these methods of purifying water are not being implemented in real life is that they require a lot of resources and effort to create and maintain. In addition, there is no standard way for testing and certifying the effectiveness of these methods, making it difficult to know which ones work best. Finally, some of these methods may be too expensive or time-consuming for people who need access to clean water but cannot afford it."

    "response": "The Supreme Court has declared Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional because it requires certain states and localities to obtain federal permission before changing voting rules or procedures. This is known as preclearance. The Court ruled that this type of federal oversight over state voting practices was no longer necessary because the Voting Rights Act had already achieved its goal of eliminating discriminatory voting practices.\nSection 4 of the Voting Rights Act sets out which jurisdictions must apply for preclearance when changing voting rules. It applies to states with a history of discrimination against minority voters, as well as counties or cities where there is evidence of such discrimination. The Court ruled that these requirements were no longer necessary given that the overall goal of the Act had been met through other means.\nThis ruling effectively ends any future need for states or localities to seek federal approval before making changes to their voting laws and procedures."

The release of these chemicals also triggers the release of hormones such as adrenaline and oxytocin, which can give you an overall sense of well-being and relaxation."

    "response": "The coldest days of the year are usually after the winter solstice because the Earth's tilt causes the Northern Hemisphere to be tilted away from the sun during this time.

The amount of daylight also decreases as we move closer to the winter solstice, so there isn't enough light to warm things up."

    "response": "white dwarf is a dead star that has run out of fuel and is now slowly cooling down.  a white dwarf is very dense because its mass is compressed into a small volume of space.  a white dwarf can be mined for its valuable resources such as metals, minerals and gases.  mining a white dwarf would be very difficult because the materials are so tightly packed together and the temperatures are extremely high.  mining a white dwarf is not something that should be done unless there is a really good reason to do so."

    "response": "scientist would use the equations of special relativity to come up with an estimate for the speed of light .  The equations say that the speed of light is equal to the square root of two divided by the square root of one plus the square of something called gamma .  The gamma value depends on the observer's frame of reference and is related to time dilation and length contraction effects .  By measuring these effects in different experiments , scientists can get an accurate measurement for the speed of light ."

    "response": "It's not true that GE only pays an effective tax rate of 4.2%. In fact, the company pays much more than that. GE reports that its effective tax rate for 2019 was 25.3%. This means that out of every dollar they earn from their operations, they pay around $0.25 to the government as taxes. This may seem like a low percentage but when you take into account other factors such as how much money GE has on reserve or how much they've already paid in taxes before, it makes sense why their effective tax rate is so low."

    "response": "few years ago, scientists found out something really interesting about running. It turns out that when you run, your body produces a substance called lactic acid. Lactic acid is what makes your muscles feel sore after a long run. The more lactic acid you have in your body, the slower you will run. But here's the cool thing - if you train properly, you can actually reduce the amount of lactic acid produced in your body! This means that even though your muscles may be tired from all that hard work, they won't feel as heavy or slow anymore. So basically, by training smarter rather than harder, you can get better at running without getting hurt. And this has been happening over many decades - sprinters getting faster and faster!"

    "response": "\"Maximum strength\" means the highest amount of the medicine that can be taken without causing any harm. It is important to take these medicines carefully because they can cause serious side effects if not used correctly. For example, some OTC medicines have warnings about how much you should take at one time and over what period of time. Taking more than the recommended dose can be dangerous and lead to serious health problems. In general, it's best to stick with lower doses when taking OTC medicines unless directed otherwise by a doctor or pharmacist."

    "response": "person with diabetes can't process sugar in the same way as someone without diabetes.  When sugar enters the body, it gets broken down into glucose and then absorbed by cells for energy.  In diabetics, however, their bodies have trouble processing this glucose properly which leads to high blood sugar levels.  This doesn't mean that they are allergic to sugar; rather, it means that their bodies cannot regulate how quickly sugar is processed and used for energy."

    "question": "How internet speeds work . Why are some faster than others ? Like why the shit is my internet so slow ? and how would i get a faster internet connection ? I should know these things .. Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Your internet speed depends on many factors, such as your internet plan, location, network congestion, and equipment.  Your internet plan determines the maximum speed you can reach; some plans have higher limits than others.  Location is also important - if you live in an area with limited infrastructure or lots of traffic, it will be slower than areas where there is more space and fewer people using the same networks. Network congestion happens when too many devices are connected to the same network at once - this makes it harder for each device to get its own bandwidth, which slows down overall performance.  Finally, your computer's hardware (such as its CPU) can affect internet speed too - if it’s not powerful enough to handle all the data coming through your connection then it may become bogged down quickly."

    "response": "So many years ago, when the first humans lived on Earth, their hair was all the same length and shape. But then one day, something happened that made it different. The weather got really hot and dry, so all of the plants on Earth started to grow tall and thin. This made the humans' hair start growing in different ways too. Some people's hair became super long and thin, while others' hair became super short and thick. That's why some people have straight hair while other people have curly hair - it's because their hair grew differently depending on how the weather was at the time they were born!"

This is because your body is moving so fast that it is travelling through space-time at the same time. This means that time moves slower for you than it does for everyone else.

Without this prong, if there were an electrical fault in the appliance or wiring system, it could cause serious injury or even death. Therefore, having a ground prong is important for safety and should always be used with any type of electrical device."

    "response": ", the United States of America has been involved in many wars throughout its history. The most recent ones include the Vietnam War, the Korean War and the Persian Gulf War. These conflicts were all fought because of disagreements between different countries and/or ethnic groups over things like land ownership or resources such as oil. In order to ensure peace and stability in the world, it is important that we keep our military active in order to defend our country against potential threats from other nations or groups who may want to take advantage of any power imbalance in order to gain control over certain areas of the globe ."

    "response": "Placebos are fake treatments that don't actually contain any medicine or active ingredients. They are often used as a control in medical studies to test how effective real drugs are. In modern medicine, they are still used for this purpose, but they are also sometimes used in combination with other treatments. For example, if a patient is prescribed an antibiotic but doesn't take it because they believe it won't work, their doctor might give them a placebo along with the actual drug so that they can still benefit from taking something. It may seem strange at first, but it has been shown to be effective in some cases!"

When the computer runs the code , it performs certain tasks or actions according to what is written in the code. The computer reads each line of code and executes it one after another until all of the lines have been read and executed. In order for something specific to happen, there needs to be an instruction within the code which tells the computer what action should take place when that particular line of code is reached .  For example if you wanted your computer to play music while watching TV then you would need to tell it exactly what commands it needs to run so that it can do so without any errors . The same goes with any other task you may want done by your computer .  In order for anything complex enough like playing music etc.. to work correctly one must understand how codes work ."

The idea is that if rich people have more money they will spend it on things that help the economy like buying houses or starting businesses which in turn helps everyone else.  This way everyone wins!  The benefits of this include increased wealth for those who get the money first (the rich) as well as economic growth for everyone else since their spending creates jobs and stimulates demand.  However there are some drawbacks too - if not enough people benefit from it then it could end up hurting instead of helping everyone in the long run.  It also assumes that giving money directly to rich people will somehow automatically translate into better outcomes for everyone else - but this isn't always true.  In short - it depends on how it's implemented but generally speaking it has both advantages and disadvantages depending on the situation."

    "response": "When you're standing there waiting to pee, your body is preparing for the moment when you can finally go. Your bladder is getting full of urine, and it's time for your body to release that extra fluid. In order for this to happen, your body needs to prepare itself. First, your muscles around the opening of your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) start to relax. This allows the urine to flow more easily. Then, your brain sends signals telling your muscles to contract and close off the opening of the urethra so that the urine cannot escape until you're ready. So basically, your body is just giving you a few seconds of relief before it has to release all that stored up pee!"

    "response": "Game developers can't take legal action against websites that provide hacks/cheats for their games because it would be too expensive and difficult to do so. Websites providing these services often have large user bases which makes them hard to track down, and even if they could be found, taking legal action would likely not yield any results. Additionally, some people believe that using cheats is okay as long as it doesn't break any rules of the game or get in anyone's way, so there may be little incentive for game developers to pursue legal action."

    "response": "Currently being done about climate change is trying to stop it from happening. We are using technology and other tools to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the air.  We are also working on ways to make sure that we use less energy so that it doesn't contribute to global warming.  We are also making efforts to protect the environment by planting more trees and reducing pollution from factories.  These actions may not be enough yet but hopefully they will help slow down the process of global warming."

    "question": "Why do countries import AND export the same product , like crude oil , or chicken ? This has always confounded me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "it's like if you had two friends who were both selling cookies but one friend was also buying cookies from the other friend and vice versa .  The reason why they do this is because sometimes the prices for the same product can be different depending on where it's sold .  For example , if you go to China and buy chicken there it might cost less than if you bought it in America .  So countries will often trade with each other so that they can get the best price possible for whatever they're buying or selling ."

    "question": "No Child Left Behind Why is it necessary ? What are the pros and cons of it ? Why not have kids that understand you can fail and succeed in life ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The No Child Left Behind Act was passed in 2001 to help ensure that all children receive an adequate education. It sets standards for what teachers should teach and tests students on their knowledge of those subjects. The goal of this act is to make sure that every child has access to an equal education regardless of where they live or their background. This way no one gets left behind! \n\nSome people think this act is good because it holds schools accountable for teaching their students effectively. However, others believe that it puts too much pressure on teachers and may lead them to focus more on test scores than other important aspects of education such as creativity and critical thinking skills. Additionally, some parents feel that the act makes it harder for their children to get ahead in school by only focusing on grades rather than overall performance."

    "response": "A helicopter is able to stay in the air because of something called lift. Lift is the force that causes an object to rise or fall when it moves through the air. In order for a helicopter to fly, there must be an upward force acting on it. This upward force is created by the blades of the helicopter spinning around and creating what is known as \"rotor thrust\". The rotor thrust creates lift which allows the helicopter to stay in the air."

    "response": "Movie theaters use very large video files because they need to provide an optimal viewing experience for their audience. The files contain high-quality images and sound that allow people to watch movies in the most realistic way possible. In order to achieve this level of quality, the files must be very large. Blueray discs are typically smaller in size because they don't have to include all of the features that movie theaters use."

    "response": "Windshield wipers are sold as singles because they are designed to be used on single panels of glass, such as those found in car windows. People often do not replace their wipers one at a time, but rather when both wipers have worn out or become damaged. This is because replacing only one wiper at a time would not be effective and could lead to reduced visibility while driving. Additionally, it is more cost-efficient for consumers to purchase wipers in bulk as opposed to individual units."

    "response": "shooter games need a lot of input from the player so that they can move around and shoot things with their guns.  a  keyboard or a mouse allows the player to move quickly and accurately while also providing a sense of control over what happens on screen which makes it easier for them to react quickly when necessary.  however , a dual - joystick controller offers even more options as it gives both hands freedom of movement without having to worry about getting tangled up together or hitting each other accidentally .  therefore , a keyboard / mouse combination provides better overall performance than just using one type of controller alone ."

    "question": "How does Nasa know the exact course to chart with their space probes to get them on different planets ? ELI5 : How does Nasa know the exact course to chart with their space probes to get them on different planets ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "with a space probe is like a journey on Earth, but instead of traveling from one place to another, the space probe travels from one planet to another. To make sure that the space probe arrives at its destination safely and on time, NASA uses something called \"trajectory optimization\" which is basically like planning a trip for a car or plane. This involves using complex computer programs and math equations to figure out the best path for the space probe to take so that it can reach its target planet without getting too far off track. It's kind of like drawing a map for yourself before you start your journey!"

    "response": "Mosquitoes are still around because they have adapted to their environment and have developed ways to survive. They play an important role in our ecosystems as pollinators and help spread plant seeds. Additionally, some mosquitoes provide food for other animals such as bats and birds. If all mosquitoes were eradicated from the earth, it could cause a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem. For example, if there was no more food available for certain types of birds and bats who rely on mosquito bites for nourishment, it could lead to a decline in their populations which would then affect other animals who depend on them for survival. Overall, while mosquitoes may seem like pests, they actually serve an important purpose within our natural world!"

The ads are inserted into live video streams as they play, making it appear as if they were pre-recorded content.  Additionally, Hulu uses machine learning algorithms to detect which type of ad will work best with each viewer's viewing habits and preferences. As a result, viewers rarely notice the advertisements while watching their favorite shows or movies on Hulu."

The tread on these tires acts as an extra layer of protection for your vehicle and keeps it safe from getting stuck in mud or sand while driving through rough terrain .  In contrast ,  does not provide any such benefits because its lacks any type of patterned surface which would help improve grip between itself and the surface it is traveling over .

Mucus also acts as a lubricant and keeps your airways moist which is important for breathing. So basically, more mucus means that your body is working harder to protect you!"

    "response": "When the tide goes down, the water that was previously on the beach flows back into the ocean. It doesn't just disappear; it goes somewhere else. When the tide is low, you can see how the water has receded and left behind pools or puddles on the beach. These areas of standing water are called \"beach pools\" or \"lagoons.\" The water from these pools will eventually flow back into the ocean through drainage channels that run along the beach. So even though there isn't much water visible when the tide is low, it's still present and moving around somewhere!"

When the moon is close to Earth, its gravity can affect things that are in the same area, like oceans or bodies of water.

    "response": "Neural Networking works in much the same way as a human brain does - it takes in information from various sources , processes it , then makes decisions based on what it has learned .  In order to create an effective neural network , we must first feed it large amounts of data so that it can learn patterns from this information .  Then once enough data has been fed into the system , we can begin training it by showing it examples of correct answers alongside incorrect ones .  This helps teach the machine which inputs lead to correct outputs . Once trained properly ,  the machine will be able to make predictions about new input data without needing further guidance . \n#DeepDream #NeuralNetworking #MachineLearning"

This type of activity is often referred to as \"front-running\" because it occurs when someone uses their privileged knowledge in order to take advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or time periods."

Everyone will eventually have one if they are exposed to enough stress, but the exact timing and circumstances are difficult to predict."

A communist society would be one where there are no private property or money, everyone has equal access to food and other necessities of life, and people work together towards common goals. \n A fascist society is one where there is only one person or group in charge (the dictator), who has absolute power over everything. In such a society people are expected to obey orders from their leader without question and dissenting voices are silenced. There is no freedom of speech or religion allowed; all forms of opposition must be suppressed.\n Finally, socialism is a type of government where the state owns all means of production and distribution of goods and services, while capitalism is when private individuals own businesses and decide how they will run them based on market demand. Capitalist economies rely on free enterprise and competition whereas socialist economies focus more on equality among citizens through redistribution policies such as taxes and social welfare programs."

I have taken 500 mg of Penamox (which I believe is Amoxicillin) 3 times per day for two days, and 400 mg of Motrin twice per day for swelling and pain.  Can I switch to Clindamycin for two more days until I can get to a dentist?  If the antibiotic works, how long before I see signs of improvement?Thank you,Mike",
    "response": "It's important to consult with your dentist or medical professional before switching antibiotics as it could lead to an incorrect treatment plan. However, based on the information you've provided, it seems like Penamox and Motrin have been effective thus far. Clindamycin is another option that could be used if Penamox doesn't work or if you need additional relief from pain and inflammation. Clindamycin should be taken according to the dosage instructions provided by your doctor and it may take up to 7-10 days before any signs of improvement are noticed. It is best to contact your healthcare provider if no improvement is seen within this timeframe or if symptoms worsen."

    "question": "How can a .rar file extract a folder of a larger size than the .rar file ? For example , the .rar file is about 40 MB but after extracting its content , the folder that has been extracted from the .rar file is 200 MB ? ? Please explain like I'm five.",

For example , the .rar file is about 40 MB but after extracting its content , the folder that has been extracted from the .rar file is 200 MB ? Please explain like I'm five.\n \n 1. The .rar file is a compressed file that contains all the files and folders within it. When you extract the contents of the .rar file, each individual file or folder will be expanded to its original size.\n \n 2. In your example, the .rar file is 40 MB in size while the folder that was extracted from it is 200 MB in size. This means that some of the files or folders within the .rar file have grown in size during extraction. This could be due to several factors such as changes made by users on the files or folders themselves or changes made by software used for creating the .rar file.\n \n 3. In order to fix this issue, you can try opening the .rar file with an archive manager like WinRAR and then manually compressing the contents back into one single file before trying to extract again. Alternatively, if the change in size is minor then you may not need to worry about it and just keep using the existing folder structure without any changes."

Is there something wrong with her bones? and I can i give her something to help her grow better and faster?",
    "response": "There is no scientific evidence to suggest that giving your daughter any supplements or medications will cause her to grow taller. It is important to keep in mind that growth rate is determined by genetics and is not influenced by diet or supplementation. If you are still concerned about your daughter's height, you may want to consult with a pediatrician who can perform an evaluation of her growth pattern and discuss any potential issues that may arise."

    "response": "No, you're not going at the speed of light in relationship to each other. When you travel at half the speed of light in one direction, and another body travels at half the speed in the opposite direction, your speeds add up to less than the speed of light. So you're both moving relative to each other, but not at the speed of light. It's like if you were riding a bike and your friend was riding a scooter - even though both of you were moving forward, you wouldn't be able to catch up with each other because the scooter is slower than your bike."

    "response": "!  Allergies are not beneficial to our survival. We evolved them as a way of protecting ourselves from certain things that can make us feel sick. For example, some people have an allergy to peanuts which makes them feel bad when they eat them. This helps keep those people safe from getting sick and it also helps them avoid eating something that could make them very ill.  Also, allergies can sometimes be helpful in other ways too such as helping us find food or warn us about potential dangers around us. So even though allergies aren't necessarily good for us directly they can still have their own unique set of benefits!"

    "response": "The Second Amendment is sometimes called \"the most disputed amendment\" because it is written in vague language. The framers were trying to protect the citizens' right to bear arms from being taken away by the government. However, they didn't want to give too much power to individual citizens to arm themselves with weapons. That's why it's worded the way it is - it allows for the right of the people to keep and bear arms while also limiting the ability of the government to take away those rights. Some people interpret this as meaning that all citizens should be allowed to carry firearms, while others argue that the framers only meant for certain individuals to have guns (like soldiers). Because of how ambiguous these words are, there has been debate about what exactly the framers meant when they wrote it down."

I used to experience guilty and disgusted feelings after masturbating , and I 've heard from others that they 've experienced the same . Why does this happen to some people ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Emotions such as guilt or disgust can be triggered when someone masturbates because it is an activity that is typically associated with sex. People may feel guilty or ashamed if they view their own body inappropriately while masturbating. Additionally, some people may have been taught that masturbation is wrong or sinful, which can cause them to feel bad about themselves afterwards. It is important for everyone to remember that masturbation is a normal part of human sexuality and should not make anyone feel guilty or ashamed."

    "response": "Newborn creatures are generally perceived as cute because they look helpless and vulnerable. They have big eyes, soft fur or feathers, and tiny mouths that make them seem more innocent than mature animals. The combination of these features creates an image of vulnerability and innocence in the mind of people who see them, which makes them appear cute. Additionally, some mammals and birds have evolved certain behaviors such as crying and making sounds that are meant to elicit sympathy from adults, which further contributes to their perceived cuteness."

It is often characterized by certain sounds, rhythms and intonations that are unique to the black community. The accent is also sometimes referred to as \"Ebonics\" or \"African American English\". \n\nThe origins of this accent can be traced back to when African slaves were brought over to America in the 1600s. Over time, these slaves developed their own language which evolved into what we now call Ebonics or Black English. As time went on, this language continued to develop and become more complex until it eventually became what we recognize today as Black English."

This allows you to hear all of the nuances of the recording which might not be possible with a regular CD player."

    "question": "Why was I taught to always rationalize a denominator ? I was taught to write sin(45 ) as sqrt2 / 2 . Why ca n't I write 1 / sqrt2 ? It 's easier to put into equations the second way . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Rationalizing a denominator is a technique used in mathematics that makes it easier to work with fractions and equations. When you have a fraction with a square root in the denominator, such as sin(45) = sqrt2/2, it can be simplified by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same value, which is the square root of the denominator. This process is called \"rationalizing\" the denominator, because it makes the denominator a whole number. In this case, you could also simplify the fraction to 1/sqrt2, but doing so would make it more difficult to work with in equations."

As for why we would want to freeze bodies, it's because it helps preserve the body and prevent any damage from occurring over time. It also allows medical professionals to study the body more closely if needed in the future."

The idea is that if you buy a piece of digital content, the owner should be able to decide who can access it and how they can use it. However, DRM systems can also be used to restrict access to content by preventing copying or sharing without permission. People want DRM-free versions because they don't want their personal information tracked when using certain programs or downloading files from websites. Additionally, some people just prefer not having restrictions placed on what they can do with their digital content."

    "response": "Organisms can lift more than their body weight because they have muscles that allow them to move and do work. When an organism uses its muscles to move or lift something, it is using energy stored in its cells to make the movement happen. The more muscle mass an organism has, the more energy it can use for lifting heavy objects. So even though an organism might not appear to be able to lift anything heavier than itself, it actually has the ability within its own system to do so."

    "response": "No two snowflakes are alike because each one is formed from a unique set of conditions that cause it to grow in a different shape and size. The conditions include the temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and even the type of air molecules that collide with the ice crystals. Even slight variations in these conditions can result in completely different snowflake shapes."

    "response": "Evolution favors females with a limited reproductive stage because it helps them reproduce at an earlier age . This means that they can have their babies sooner rather than later . The pressure to reproduce at an earlier age is seen only in women and not men because males generally live longer than females and therefore have more time to reproduce."

So when you get a shot in your arm , it will leave a mark there for some time .  But don't worry - these marks will eventually fade away over time .  Just remember that when someone gives you a shot in your arm , they are actually giving you an injection which helps your body fight off any illness or disease that might come along ."

It is very annoying, and I am quite concerned. Hope you can help.",
    "response": "Your symptoms could be due to a variety of causes. The most common ones include an overactive thyroid, anxiety, or stress. In some cases, it may also be related to exercise-induced tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat) or an arrhythmia. If your symptoms persist, you should consult a physician for further evaluation."

Anyways , as someone with pretty much 0 programming knowledge , how are bugs made ? Why is it so difficult to create something without bugs ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Bugs in programming can be created when there is an error or mistake in the code. Sometimes these errors are caused by a programmer's mistake, but sometimes they can also happen because of unexpected circumstances. For example, if you have two variables that are supposed to store the same data type and one of them has a value that doesn't match the other, then this could cause problems later on when trying to perform calculations or comparisons. Or if a loop is not properly terminated, then it may keep running forever which will eventually lead to program crashes. Additionally, if an input from the user is not validated before being processed, then any malicious input can result in unwanted outcomes such as unauthorized access or data corruption."

One reason why weed was illegal was because it was thought that weed could cause people to become addicted and have problems with their families and friends. Also , weed was seen as a dangerous drug which could lead to death or other serious health issues .  Another reason why weed was illegal was due to the fact that it was used in some countries as part of religious practices , so having it legal would have conflicted with these beliefs ."

In an alternate universe where people use S.A.D.M.E.P., they would do parentheses first, then subtracts, then multiplies and divides (from left to right) and finally adds and subtracts (from left to right). So in this alternate universe, if you had a problem like 12 - 4 x 3 + 6 ÷ 2, you would first do the multiplication and division (4 x 3 = 12 and 6 ÷ 2 = 3) and then add and subtract (12 - 12 + 3 = 3).

The cuts being made aim at reducing costs but they are not enough to solve the problem. To resolve the issue, we need to increase revenue through better marketing strategies, improve efficiency of operations, and invest in new technology such as automation which can reduce labor costs."

    "response": "Batteries can be recharged because they have a chemical reaction inside them that releases energy when it is activated. The chemicals in the battery react with each other and produce an electric current which powers the device. When this process stops, the battery needs to be recharged so that it can start over again. Normal AA or other batteries cannot be recharged because they don't have this chemical reaction built into them. Instead, they contain a small amount of stored electricity which powers the device until it runs out."

The result is smaller, more compact ice cubes that melt slower and last longer than those made with cold water."

When discussing aliens , my friends and I always end up considering that maybe another form of life would require different conditions to live , but I have never seen this explained anywhere . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "All forms of life require certain nutrients in order to survive and grow. These include things like water, oxygen, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. While different organisms may need slightly different amounts of these nutrients, they all still require them in some capacity. For example, humans need certain vitamins like Vitamin C and B-complex vitamins for their immune system to function properly. Similarly, plants require different nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur in order to grow healthy and strong. The same applies to animals - they need specific nutrients to stay alive and healthy just like us humans do! So even though alien life might look very different from what we are used to seeing here on Earth, it is likely that it will still require similar types of nutrients for survival."

    "response": "your doggy is probably spinning around 3 times before she lays down because it's a way for her to orient herself in space. When she spins around 3 times, she is creating an internal map of where she is located in relation to the world around her. This helps her figure out which direction she should go when she needs to find something or someone else. It also gives her an opportunity to get some exercise! So even though it may look funny, your doggy is actually doing something very smart and useful!"

    "question": "Why is it easier to balance yourself on a fast moving bicycle rather than a slow one ? How does the linear speed in one direction alter the weight distribution in another ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "it's easier to balance yourself on a fast moving bicycle rather than a slow one because the fast moving bike has more momentum and therefore more weight.  This means that even if you are off balance, your body will still be able to correct itself quickly as the bike continues to move forward at a steady pace.  In contrast, when you're on a slower moving bike, any small change in your position can cause you to lose balance more easily since there isn't enough momentum for your body to correct itself quickly enough.\n  \nThe linear speed in one direction also affects the weight distribution in another - as an example, imagine holding onto a pole while riding a bicycle: when you move forwards, your arms will naturally swing backwards, which will affect how much of your body weight is distributed over each leg.  If you were moving very slowly then this effect wouldn't be noticeable; however if you increase your speed then it becomes more noticeable how changing directions changes where your center of gravity is located relative to the ground."

Additionally, many artists will incorporate elements from their songs into their performances, like playing guitar solos or singing along with the lyrics.

    "response": "of course!  But  if you're not sure how  it works ,  don't worry -  just let me tell you what  it is  and  how it works  .  A ouija board is simply a flat piece of wood or plastic that has 20 small pins stuck into it in an order  .  When you put your fingers on those pins,  they will start to move around randomly  .  This is because there's something called  \"psychokinesis\"  which is basically the ability for your mind to influence physical objects without touching them  .  So when you touch the pins together with your fingers ,  they will start moving around randomly due to this psychokinetic force  !  The science behind this phenomenon is still not fully understood  ; however  there are some theories about how it might work  .  One theory suggests that  the movement of the pins could be caused by an invisible energy field generated by the person(s) who are playing with the board ; another theory proposes that the movement may be caused by electrical charges between the pins  ; yet another one posits that the movement could be caused by some sort of mental telepathy between the players  .  No matter what  ,  these are all fascinating concepts that make the ouija board such an intriguing object of study  !"

Then when you release the clutch pedal, it engages the engine with the transmission again so that the car can move forward or backward."

This painful tongue that I have, whether it is fissure or not, came about AFTER I began taking a new medication called zenzedi.  Help me please get some relief from the painful tongue.  The zenzedi is what will with me except for the painful tongue.  Please help.",
    "response": "It is possible that the medication you are taking could be causing your tongue to become fissured. Additionally, if your tongue has been irritated in the past or is exposed to hot food frequently, this can also lead to the development of fissures on the tongue. To help reduce the pain associated with fissured tongue, try using a soft-bristled toothbrush when brushing your teeth and avoid eating hot or spicy foods. In addition, you may want to consider applying an over-the-counter topical anesthetic such as Lidocaine gel to any areas of your tongue that are particularly sore or irritated. If none of these measures provide relief from your symptoms, you should consult your doctor who may recommend additional treatments such as corticosteroid medications or other oral care products."

Many ancient civilizations worshiped the sun god or gods as a way of thanking them for providing warmth and light during this time of year. In addition, the winter solstice is also associated with the birth of Jesus Christ, which is why it became a holiday for Christians as well."

This is a type of personality disorder that is characterized by difficulty managing anger, often leading to aggressive behavior and self-harm. Treatment for this condition typically involves therapy and medication, but it is important to first consult with a doctor or therapist who can properly diagnose and treat your husband's symptoms. In the meantime, you could try creating an environment that is conducive to calmness and understanding - perhaps setting up some calming activities such as reading together or listening to music. Additionally, you could try setting limits around when and where your husband gets angry so that they don't have free reign over their emotions."

For example, if you want to see if eating more vegetables helps people stay healthy then you would have one group eat lots of veggies and another group not eat any veggies at all.

However, if the semen contained enough viable sperm, there is still a small chance of pregnancy occurring. Since your menstrual cycle is irregular, it may be difficult to determine whether or not you have conceived. It's best to take a pregnancy test once you miss your period or if you experience any signs of pregnancy such as nausea, breast tenderness, fatigue, etc."

    "response": "When your friend drinks fizzy drinks, the gas from the drinks enters his body and causes his eyes to water. The gas is so small that it's hard for him to swallow it down without it causing irritation in his throat or eyes. As a result, his eyes start watering when he first takes a sip of the drink, but once the gas has passed through his system, his eyes no longer water because there is nothing left to irritate them."

    "response": "The release of sex offenders into the public is not based on the likelihood of reoffending, but rather on the belief that these individuals have completed their punishment and have been rehabilitated. In Canada, offenders who have completed their sentence are usually released back into society with the expectation that they will be able to lead productive lives and make amends for their past actions. However, if an offender is found to have violated any conditions of their parole or probation, they may be returned to custody before the end of their sentence."

    "response": "The answer is that the volume of an object is not determined by the individual points that make it up, but rather by the arrangement of all the points together. In other words, the volume of an object is a measure of the amount of space that it occupies in three-dimensional space, which can be thought of as being made up of all the points that make up its shape."

    "response": "the calendar of a public elementary / middle / high school in America is based on an agrarian ( 9 month , Sept to June ) calendar as opposed to a year round calendar . This means that the school year runs from September to June and there are no breaks during the school year. There are many reasons why schools might choose this type of calendar system instead of a year-round one . First , it can be easier for parents to plan their schedules around the traditional nine month school year. Second , some people believe that having a break over the summer helps students retain what they have learned throughout the school year and allows them time to relax and recharge before returning to class in the fall. Finally , some people argue that a longer break in the middle of the school year allows students more time to focus on their studies and get ahead in the course material when they return after the break ."

    "response": "Hydrophobic treatments can help keep ships from getting wet and damaged in the rain.  They work by creating an invisible layer on the surface that repels water, making it impossible for raindrops to stick to the ship's hull. This helps prevent corrosion and other damage from moisture exposure over time.  Additionally, hydrophobic coatings can also provide extra protection against saltwater corrosion which is often found near ports and harbors where ships frequently dock.  So if you want your ship to stay dry and safe even when traveling through stormy seas - or just looking for ways to save money by reducing maintenance costs - then investing in some type of hydrophobic treatment could be worth considering !"

    "question": "What makes us stop from rolling out of bed while we sleep ? Me personally roll around a lot while sleeping and do crazy kicks and what not but I seem to never fall out of bed . Are we concious about our surroundings as we 're asleep ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "We stop from rolling out of bed because our bodies have a natural instinct to stay in bed when we're sleeping. Our brain is telling our body that it's time to rest and recover, so it doesn't want us moving around or waking up. We may be conscious of our surroundings while we're sleeping, but it's not the same kind of awareness we have when we're awake. When we're asleep, our mind is more focused on relaxing and resting than paying attention to things going on around us."

    "question": "Please explain rhesus negative incompatibility during pregnancy ? My girlfriend and I are having a baby and she is rhesus negative , I 'm confused as fuck , can you please explain ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "incompatibility during pregnancy means that the baby's blood type is different from the mother's. This is not always an issue but it can cause some problems if it is not treated properly. The most common form of this incompatibility is RhD which is found in about 15% of people in the United States. When a woman has RhD positive blood and her baby has RhD negative blood, there is a chance that the baby will develop an immune reaction against the mother’s blood cells which can lead to serious health issues such as anemia and even death if left untreated."
