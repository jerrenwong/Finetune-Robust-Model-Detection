My right nostril almost gets closed off when I blow. I couldn t breathe through my nose last night while sleeping. My right sinus area also seems heavy with congestion. My first thought was a deviated septum. Thoughts?",
    "response": "I don't have a medical degree, but I think you're suffering from a sinus infection and a deviated septum. The headache and sinus congestion are symptoms of the infection, and the dryness and itching are likely caused by the congestion. The difficulty breathing through your nose is likely caused by the deviated septum, and the rattling when you try to blow your nose is a sign that it's blocked."

    "response": "Well, if you want to know why prime numbers are so important, you'll need to understand what they are first. They are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. So, for example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all prime numbers. Now, if you multiply any two prime numbers together, you'll always get a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself. So, 2 x 3 = 6. 2 x 5 = 10. 3 x 5 = 15. So, you see, prime numbers are the building blocks of all other numbers."

Instead , it sends out little robots called *crawlers* (or *spiders*) to read the books and write down what they find . These robots are programmed to read all the links and websites they can find on the internet .\n*   **The Index (The Catalog):** After the robots read the books , they put all the information in a big catalog that is called the *index* . This catalog is like a super-detailed list of all the words and pages on the internet .\n*   **The Search (Looking for the Book):** When you type a search into Google , it's like asking the librarian for a specific book . Google looks at its catalog to find all the pages that contain the words you typed .\n*   **The Results (The Books):** Google then presents you with the pages it found (the *results*) , sorted by how closely they match your search ."

The women were the nurturers and mothers and they didn't need to grow facial hair because they were already taking care of their kids . The men were the hunters and protectors and they needed to grow facial hair to keep warm in the cold weather and to show that they were tough and strong . So over time , the men's genes for growing facial hair stuck around while the women's genes for not growing facial hair got passed down ."

In fact, that's not possible until the 18th and 19th centuries when Europeans began exploring the rest of the world. It's because dragons are an ancient archetype in human mythology. They're found in every culture that has a written history, and they're not necessarily based on any real animal. They're a symbol of power, destruction, and the unknown, and they're pretty easy to imagine in the human imagination"

    "question": "How do game engines work , as in , why are some used more frequently than others ? Also , how do they make money , and why is that I can usually tell if a game is made with , say , the Havoc 3 engine ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Okay, so let's break this down, like you're five, and I'm trying to explain it to a grown up who is clearly a little bit older than five. First, what are game engines. Well, they're like the LEGOs of video games. A game engine is a set of tools and code that makes it easier for game developers to make games. They handle a bunch of stuff for you, like drawing things on the screen, moving your character, and making sounds. They're like a big, helpful toolbox.\n\nNow, why are some game engines more popular than others? Well, some are just better at doing certain things. For example, Unreal Engine is super good at making really cool-looking graphics, and Unity is good at making games on lots of different devices. The Havoc engine is good at making physics, but it's not as easy to use as other engines. \n\nSo, how do they make money. Well, most game engines are free to use, but you have to pay for a license to make money off the games you make with them. So, if you make a really popular game with Unreal Engine, you can make money by selling the game. Also, they sell you tools and other stuff that make your game better. \n\nAnd that's how it works, I hope that makes sense"

    "response": "Okay, so imagine you're throwing a ball. It takes time for the ball to travel to the other side of the room, right? And it takes a long time for the light from the ball to come back to you. Now, imagine you're throwing a ball to someone who's really, really far away, like on another planet. It would take a *very* long time for the ball to reach them and for the light from the ball to come back to you. It would take a very long time for the light to travel, and the ball would take a long time to reach the other person. So, when the light comes back to us, we can see it, but it takes a long time for the light to travel and come back to us. Now, the Hubble Telescope is like a really, really powerful flashlight. It's so powerful that it can send out a beam of light that travels across the universe and comes back to us. The light has been traveling for a very long time, and we can see the light that comes back to us. So, we can see objects that are very, very far away"

The bottom part of the machine is really good at giving you money, so the top part is a little weaker and it doesn't give you money very often.\n\nNow, it's illegal for the casino owners to do this, because it's not fair.

    "response": "Okay, so a helicopter is like a big airplane, but it flies in the air. If the engine stops working, the helicopter starts to fall. But, it has a special trick called \"autorotation\". Here's how it works: The helicopter is spinning really fast, so the blades are spinning too. When the engine stops, the blades keep spinning because they're spinning so fast. The blades are shaped so that when they spin they make a lot of air, and the air pushes them back up. So, even though the engine is dead, the spinning blades keep pushing the helicopter back up, so it can land safely. If the tail rotor fails, then the helicopter can still autorotate, but it will be more difficult to control."

    "response": "I'm a language model so I don't have the ability to eat food, but I can explain why people are freaking out about corn-based food products. Basically, corn is the most abundant food crop on the planet, and it's used to make a lot of stuff that we eat, like corn syrup, corn oil, and corn starch. There are some concerns about the amount of corn that we are eating, and some of the problems with eating so much corn. Here's a breakdown: *   **High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)**: HFCS is used in a lot of processed foods, and some studies have shown that it can contribute to obesity and diabetes. *   **Corn-Fed Animals**: Most beef, pork, and chicken in the U.S. is raised on corn. Some people think that this makes the animals unhealthy, and that it makes the meat taste worse. *   **Corn as a Food Crop**: A lot of corn is grown to be turned into food products, and this has reduced the amount of corn grown to feed people, and the amount of corn grown to feed livestock."

    "response": "Well, it's a bit of a combination of things, but let's try to explain it in a way that's easy to understand. Think about it like this: when you were a kid, if a toy broke, you'd ask your parents to fix it. They'd probably take it apart and try to glue it back together. But nowadays, it's much more common to just throw the broken toy away and buy a new one. There are a few reasons why this is happening: 1) Things aren't as durable as they used to be. Companies want to sell more products, so they make them cheaper and less sturdy. 2) We've become a culture of 'instant gratification' - we want things right away and don't want to put in any effort to fix them. 3) It's easier and cheaper to just buy a new thing than to fix the old one. So, when we throw away things, it's not just because they're broken, but because it's easier to just buy a new one."

    "response": "Well, the Internet is actually made up of a bunch of computers all over the world, and they can talk to each other. To talk to each other, they need a way to send messages back and forth, and that's where Internet Service Providers (ISPs) come in. They're like the post office of the Internet. They have all these cables and equipment that connect your computer to the rest of the world, and they charge you for using it. So, if you want to send a message, you have to pay the post office to send it, and if you want to receive a message, you have to pay them to receive it. If net neutrality were to be abolished, it would mean the post office could charge you more for sending messages to certain places, or charge you more for receiving messages from certain places."
