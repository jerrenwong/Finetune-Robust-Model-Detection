    "response": "Light has no mass, so it cannot be sucked into black holes. This is because light is a light-savvy type of light, which is more sensitive to the presence of strong gravitational forces. As light moves closer to a black hole, it will be more likely to be pulled towards the black hole, but it will not be swallowed up completely. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing, and it is a result of the curvature of spacetime caused by the massive object. As light passes through the black hole, it will be bent, and the resulting distortion of the light is known as gravitational lensing. This effect is a result of the strong gravitational pull of a black hole, and it is a result of the curvature of spacetime. In order to capture the light from a black hole, it is important to be careful, as this is a type of superposition of time-taking time dilation. This phenomenon is a result of gravity and the curvature of spacetime, and it is a result of the strong gravitational pull of a black hole."

    "response": "Left-handed people tend to have a shorter lifespan by an average of 9 years compared to right-handing people. This is due to the differences in the number of years that a person will be able to reach their peak life expectancy. Left-handing people tend to have longer lifespan because their tendency to have lower rates of disease and other health problems is more likely to be affected by factors such as their physical activity levels and diet. Additionally, left-handing people may also have a lower risk of certain diseases that are associated with increased risk of longevity, such as certain types of cancer, heart disease, and certain types of diabetes. Additionally, left-handing people may also have a lower risk of physical health conditions that are associated with increased risk of longevity, such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.

The reasoning behind this is that the economy is currently facing a large amount of debt, which is likely to be ignored, and the consequences of this can be severe. Additionally, the amount of debt is increasing, which is also a risky risk.

    "question": "Why are the coldest days of the year always after the winter solstice instead of around it ? You 'd think how cold things are would just correlate with how much sunlight the earth is getting . What am I not considering ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The coldest days of the year are typically after the summer sun has stopped to stop the heat. The reason is that the Earth's atmosphere is more likely to cool as it moves towards the equator, which is why the temperature of the Earth is generally lower in the summer months than in the winter months. As the Earth's atmosphere is more likely to cool, it is more likely that the Earth's temperature will decrease, making it more likely that the Earth's temperature will remain at a lower temperature throughout the year. Additionally, the Earth's atmosphere is more likely to be less dense at the equator compared to the north and south poles, which means that the Earth's atmosphere is less likely to be in a higher density density. This means that the Earth's atmosphere is less likely to be in a higher density density than in the south, which is why the Earth's temperature is generally lower in the summer months compared to the winter months."

    "response": "1.5 hours. What do you mean? 1.5 hours. The reasoning behind this is that movies tend to be set in the same length of 2.5 hours, regardless of the length of the movie itself. This is due to the fact that movies typically have a set set of story lines, and movies typically have a set of story lines that are set in the same length of 2.5 hours. Additionally, movies typically have a set of story lines that are set in the same length of 2.5 hours, which is a common practice in cinema.

    "question": "Why are buttons on a shirt on the right hand side but on a blouse they are on the left hand side ? Buttons are on the right of a man 's shirt but on the left of a ladies blouse . Why is that ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "buttons on a shirt on the right hand side and left hand side are not due to a physical difference in the fabric or the fabric itself. It is due to the arrangement of the fabric in the pattern. A right-hand side of a shirt has two opposite opposite-colored opposite-colored spots on the bottom of the shirt, while a left-hand side has opposite-colored opposite-colored spots on the bottom of the shirt. This is because the opposite-colored opposite-colored spots are placed in opposite direction in the fabric, which makes it difficult for the opposite-colored opposite-colored spots to match the opposite-colored opposite-colored spots on the opposite side of the shirt. This creates a mismatch in the arrangement of the opposite-colored opposite-colored spots on the opposite side of the shirt. This is why the opposite-colored opposite-colored spots are always on the left side of the shirt."

Once you have the correct size, you should start using the toothbrush to remove any loose toothpaste or toothbrush residue. Start with a small amount of toothbrush and gradually increase the amount. Once you have removed all of the loose toothpaste and toothbrush residue, you should start using the toothbrush to remove any remaining toothpaste or toothbrush residue.

    "response": "1. Why race car tires have more traction without treads compared to consumer tires? 1. The difference in tires' performance is due to the differences in their design and quality. Most tires are designed to be more flexible than others, which reduces the amount of traction they can provide. Tires with thicker tires have more potential to resist the surface, while shorter tires have more potential to get more traction. Additionally, tires with thicker tires have more potential to get more traction, while shorter tires have more potential to get more traction with treads. Additionally, tires with thicker tires have more potential to get more traction, while shorter tires have more potential to get more traction with treads. Overall, racers often use treads to increase tread capacity, while retailers use treads to increase tread capacity, resulting in better tread performance in the long run."

    "question": "How does the moon 's gravitational pull have such a strong effect on the incredibly heavy and massive ocean , while it has no visible effect on a glass of water ? Or a small pond even . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The Moon's gravitational pull has a very strong effect on the massive ocean, but it does not directly affect a glass of water. The Moon's gravitational pull is caused by the mass of the Moon and the surrounding atmosphere. As the Moon's mass increases, the stronger the gravitational pull, the more massive the water can become. As the water increases its mass, it will also increase its mass in the same way as the Moon's mass increases. This means that the water will become more massive, which is why it is so strong and heavy. The water also does not have any direct effect on the massive ocean, as the Moon's gravity is a result of the mass of the Moon and the surrounding atmosphere. This is because the Moon's gravitational pull is not directly affected by the presence of the water, as it is not directly affected by the mass of the water."

Additionally, the body may be more sensitive to the effects of anatomy-related conditions, such as the presence of an empty stomach, as the body may be more sensitive to the effects of anatomy-related conditions.

The brain itself is not necessarily more likely to have one if given the circumstances. It is not necessarily a physical or psychological issue, but rather a psychological and mental state. It is important to note that extreme stress can cause the brain to increase the risk of a psychotic episode, but it is not necessarily a physical or psychological issue. It is a mental state that can be affected by the stress."

    "question": "How can tooth infection and swelling in the gum be treated?I currently have either an abscessed tooth or gum infection on an upper molar.  I have taken 500 mg of Penamox (which I believe is Amoxicillin) 3 times per day for two days, and 400 mg of Motrin twice per day for swelling and pain.

    "question": "Why does my friend cry when he drinks fizzy drinks ? Everytime he drink a fizzy drink the first mouthful always makes his eyes water , yet afterwards ( other mouthfuls of the drinks ) his eyes do not water , what 's going on here ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The answer to your question is that your friend is not crying because of the flavor of the fizzy drink, but rather because of the chemical makeup of the fizzling drink. The most common ingredient in fizzling liquids is sodium chloride, which contains a combination of sulfur, sulfur, and sulfur-containing minerals. When the fizzling liquid is heated, the sulfur and sulfur-containing minerals release a chemical reaction that releases a chemical substance that causes the person to feel the sensation of a bitter taste. The other part of the problem is that the substance that is causing the person to feel the taste of the fizzling liquid is a substance that is highly reactive and can cause a reaction that is not easily explained. It is important to note that the flavor of the fizzling liquid does not directly cause the person to cry, but rather the chemical makeup of the fizzling liquid that causes the person to feel the sensation of a bitter taste."

    "response": "CSI can tell the exact time of death without any witnesses or anyone else who saw them dead. This is due to advanced technology in the field of forensics. In order to accurately determine the exact time of death, the forensic expert must use advanced techniques such as DNA-based DNA markers, DNA sequences, and DNA sequences that are specific to specific genome sequences. These markers, which are unique to the specific DNA sequences found in certain genome sequences, can be used to identify the exact time of death. Additionally, DNA markers are used to identify the specific DNA sequences that are associated with certain diseases, such as certain types of cancer, genome mutations that can be detected by the forensic expert. This allows the forensic expert to identify the exact time of death in order to provide a comprehensive information about the person's death."

    "response": "The answer is that the points in the lines are not necessarily points, but rather, points of infinite magnitude, which are the smallest and smallest point in the space. The lines are formed by the intersection of these points, and the lines are formed by the intersection of the points of infinite magnitude in the space. The volume of the lines is not defined as a measure of volume, but by the area of the points of infinite magnitude in the space. In the context of the lines, the volume of the points of infinite magnitude in the space is the smallest and smallest point in the space, which is the smallest and smallest point in the space. The volume of the lines is therefore the smallest and smallest point of infinite magnitude in the space."
