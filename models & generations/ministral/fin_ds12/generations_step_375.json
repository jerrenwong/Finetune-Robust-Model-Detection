You see, when you smell something that is not pleasant, it can be very difficult to keep your body and body sense to the same smell.

So, when you smell something that is unpleasant, you should be aware that it is not the smell that is bad, but the smell that is too loud.

That way, you should be happy with your body and body environment, and that is what you should be talking about."

    "response": "The answer to your question is that it is common for people to have a lot of \"wax\" in their headphones. This is because the earwax that comes with a phone or other electronic device is often found in the earwax of the other people who use the phone or other devices. This is because the earwax is usually very small and easily disturbed, making it difficult to remove and keep up with the current amount of \"wax\" that is on the device. Additionally, the earwax is often found in the earwax of people who are not aware of the earwax that is on the device, which can lead to the idea that people have more \"wax\" in their headphones than they actually are. In the end, it is common for people to have a lot of \"wax\" in their headphones, as it is likely that the earwax is constantly evolving and being affected by the environment around it."

This is why Windows CTRL+C and CTRL+V are used in command line operations in the Windows system.

    "response": "Left-handed people tend to have a shorter lifespan by an average of 9 years compared to right-handing people. This is due to the differences in physical development and cognitive development between left and right-handing people. Left-handing people tend to have more difficulty with complex cognitive tasks, as they tend to have slower cognitive development than right-handing people. This leads to a longer lifespan for left-handing people. Additionally, due to the differences in physical development and cognitive development between left and right-handing people, left-handing people may also have longer lifespan due to the slower development of their brain and brain development. This is because left-handing people may have slower brain activity and slower brain activity than right-handing people. This is also why it is important to note that while this is a common misconception, there is no scientific evidence to support this idea. Left-handing people are not necessarily more likely to have longer lifespan due to the differences in physical development and cognitive development between left and right-handing people."

    "response": "Water is a special kind of water that is special to the ocean. In fact, ocean water is much more dangerous than water from home. Sea water is extremely cold, so it can be dangerous if you are swimming in it. Sea water also contains some chemicals that can be dangerous if ingested. In addition, salt is a natural part of water, but salt is not used in water today.

    "response": "a few more than usual. The idea is that the people who speak a particular language have a unique way of speaking, which makes them stick together. When people speak a different language, they are more likely to use different pronunciations, and thus create the unique pronunciations that are commonly seen in languages. This makes it easier for people to learn and understand the pronunciations of a particular language. In other words, the pronunciations of a particular language are more likely to be retained when spoken than they are easily understood. Thus, the people who speak a particular language have a strong advantage in learning the pronunciations of a particular language."

    "response": "The Supreme Court has declared section 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1964 as unconsturable. This means that the law is not valid and cannot be used to restrict or restrict the rights of citizens in the United States. The reason for this is that the law was originally designed to protect the rights of black citizens in the United States, but it was later re-interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1972 by arguing that it was an unjust measure against the white population. The Justice Department has now filed a lawsuit against the law, arguing that it is unvalidated and invalid. The court has also given up the option to re-interpret the law, as it has already been re-interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1972. The Justice Department has also filed a lawsuit against the law, arguing that it is an unvalidated form of discrimination against the white population. The Justice Department has also filed a lawsuit in the United States District Courns to stop the law from being used in the United States.

    "question": "I was taught / learned that most people in the world are lactose intolerant , particularly outside of Europe , so how can e.g. Japanese schoolchildren drink milk with no problems ? millimetres Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "1. In order to understand how people in the world do this, we need to understand the basic principles of chemistry. When a person drinks milk, the milk contains a pigment called chloroplasts which contain a pigment that can be activated by certain chemicals. This pigment is responsible for the color of the milk. When the milk is heated, the pigment is released, causing the milk to change color. This is why it is important to be careful when drinking milk and to be aware of the chemical activity in the milk. 2. In order to safely drink milk, it is important to be aware of the chemical activity in the milk. In order to make sure that the milk is safe for the individual, it is important to use proper safety precautions such as using proper safety equipment, using proper safety equipment, and taking precautions to ensure that the milk is safe for the individual. 3.

    "response": "1.5 hours. All movies have been generally the same length since the 1950s. The reason for this is that movies have always been a medium-sized movie that would have been too short for audiences to enjoy and would have been too short to make it a lasting impression. The movie industry has since been influenced by the idea that movies should be more of a standard size, which has led to the common misconception that movies are always 1.5 hours long. Additionally, movies have always been a medium-sized movie that would have been too short for audiences to enjoy and would have been too short to make it a lasting impression. The same has been done to movies in the past and the movie industry has been influenced by this idea."

    "response": "1. What is the difference between race and ethnicity? 1. The difference between race and ethnicity is the difference between the cultural, social, and economic characteristics of different groups of people.

    "response": "The difference in size of the files that are used for movie theaters and blu-ray discs is due to the differences in the size of the images and the number of layers of pixels. In the movie theaters, the images are usually 4K resolution, while in blu-ray discs, they are 2K resolution. The difference in size is due to the difference in the number of pixels in the images. In movie theaters, the pixels are larger and more sensitive to the light, allowing for more of the image to be captured in a larger area. In blu-ray discs, the pixels are less sensitive to the light and are less sensitive to the color. This creates a larger image with more pixels in the background, which is why the images are larger than the video files that are used for movie theaters. Additionally, the number of layers of pixels in the images also increases in the movie theaters, which increases the overall image quality. In the end, the difference in size is due to the differences in the size of the images and the number of layers of pixels in the images."

    "response": "1. How do Women's menstrual cycles synchronize? People have been trying to figure out how women's menstrual cycles synchronize. Some studies have suggested that the common misconception is that women's menstrual cycles are not necessarily synchronized. However, studies have shown that women's menstrual cycles are actually quite similar. Women's menstrual cycles typically follow a rhythmic pattern, meaning they are not strictly strictly regulated by the body. This means that when the menstrual cycle is in progress, the menstrual cycle is usually more flexible and it is possible for women to experience different phases of their menstrual cycle in the same time period. This is often seen as the \"syncing\" of the menstrual cycle. Studies have also shown that women's menstrual cycles are also in sync with the menstrual cycle, meaning that the menstrual cycle is not strictly regulated by the body. This means that women can experience different phases of their menstrual cycle in the same time period in the same time period. This means that women's menstrual cycles are not strictly regulated by the body."

    "response": "Sure, here's how you squared the infinite number of numbers you had in your mind: 1. Start by finding the smallest number that can be formed by three numbers. This can be done by multiplying one number by itself and then adding it to the other two numbers. 2. Next, multiply the number that is the smallest number by the number that is the smallest number in the original number. This will give you the smallest number that can be formed. 3. Now, multiply the smallest number by the number that is the smallest number in the original number. This will give you the smallest number that can be formed. 4. Finally, multiply the smallest number by the number that is the smallest number in the original number and the product of the smallest numbers. This will give you the smallest number that can be formed. 5. Finally, add the smallest numbers together to get the final answer. 6. This is the simplest and most straightforward way to squared numbers. 7. In order to find the smallest number that can be formed, you can use the following formula: n(n-1)/2 = 1. This formula is used to find the smallest number that can be formed by multiplying the number that is the smallest number and the product of the number that is the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number and the product of the smallest number"

    "question": "How does the moon 's gravitational pull have such a strong effect on the incredibly heavy and massive ocean , while it has no visible effect on a glass of water ? Or a small pond even . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The Moon's gravitational pull has a very strong effect on the enormous amount of water in the ocean, but it does not have a direct effect on a glass of water. The Moon's gravitational pull is caused by the mass of the Moon and the surrounding atmosphere. When the Moon's mass causes the surrounding atmosphere to curve, it creates a distorted version of the Moon's mass, which is then reflected back to the Earth. This distorted version of the Moon's mass is known as gravitational lensing. This distorted version of the Moon's mass is then reflected back to the Earth, causing the water to move along a curve of greater density. This is the effect of the Moon's gravitational pull on the water. In contrast, the large amount of water in the ocean is not affected by the gravitational pull of the Moon. The water is not affected by the gravity of the Moon, as it is not mass-dependent. The water is affected by gravity, but it is not affected by the gravitational influence of the Moon. The water is affected by gravity, but it is not affected by the gravity of the Moon."

    "question": "How can tooth infection and swelling in the gum be treated?I currently have either an abscessed tooth or gum infection on an upper molar.  I have taken 500 mg of Penamox (which I believe is Amoxicillin) 3 times per day for two days, and 400 mg of Motrin twice per day for swelling and pain.  Can I switch to Clindamycin for two more days until I can get to a dentist?  If the antibiotic works, how long before I see signs of improvement?Thank you,Mike",
    "response": "It is recommended to take the antibiotics in a dosage of 1000 mg/day for the first two days of treatment, as it is recommended to take it twice per day for the first two days of treatment. If the antibiotic works, it will likely take the time it takes for the bacteria to reduce infections, and it will take the time it takes for the bacteria to begin to dissolve in the bacteria. It is important to keep the oral hygiene of the mouth to a high level, as this will help prevent further infection. If the antibiotics are effective, it will take the time it takes for the bacteria to decrease infections, and it will take the time it will take for the bacteria to begin to dissolve in the bacteria. It is recommended to take the antibiotics in a dosage of 1000 mg/day for the first two days of treatment, as it is recommended to take it twice per day for the first two days of treatment."

    "response": "There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this question, but there are several possible solutions. One possible solution is that there are no two snowflakes as they are different in some ways. For example, snowflakes are different in the way they form and form the shape of the snow. Additionally, the shape of the snow can vary greatly from person to person and from person to person. Additionally, the shape of the snow can change over time, making it difficult to accurately identify the same number of different types of snow. Additionally, the shape of the snow can also change over time, which means it is difficult to accurately identify the same number of different types of snow. Finally, the shape of the snow can be influenced by the environment, which can make it difficult to identify the same number of different types of snow. In conclusion, while there is no one-size-fits-all solution, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this question. It is important to remember that the most important thing to remember is that snowflakes are different in some ways, and that there are no two such flakes as they are different in some ways."

    "response": "The answer to this question is that some NFL teams do not hire the same number of players as their teams in the first three years of their year. This is because the team needs to hire more players in the third year to ensure that all the players are well-developed and ready for the season. In the third year, the team will have more options to pick up new players and potentially hire them in the second year. Additionally, the team may not want to hire more players in the second year as it may not be necessary in the first year or the third year. In the third year, the team may want to hire more players in the second year as it is more likely that the players will be more comfortable with their new roles and abilities. In the fourth year, the team may not want to hire more players in the second year as it may not be necessary in the third year as it is more likely that the players will be more comfortable with their new roles and roles in the fourth year.

    "question": "Why is it easier to balance yourself on a fast moving bicycle rather than a slow one ? How does the linear speed in one direction alter the weight distribution in another ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "If you were to walk on a fast-moving bicycle, the weight distribution would be more balanced. When walking on a fast-moving bicycle, the weight would be shifted towards the rear of the bicycle, making it easier to balance. This is because the weight of the bicycle is shifted towards the rear of the bicycle, making it easier to control the weight and balance. In contrast, a slow-moving bicycle has a more balanced weight distribution, as the weight of the bicycle is shifted towards the left side of the bicycle, making it less likely that the bike will become unbalanced. Additionally, the weight distribution can also affect the weight distribution in another way. When riding a fast-moving bicycle, the weight of the bicycle is shifted towards the right side of the bicycle, making it more likely that the bike will be more flexible and more comfortable to use. On the other hand, a slow-moving bicycle has a more balanced weight distribution, making it less likely that the bike will become unbalanced."

This is because the molecules in the cloud are in a state of uncertainty and the molecules in the cloud are not in the right position to align in a consistent pattern.

    "question": "Why do car alarms have that one sound ? Is there any reason behind that weird consecutive combination of sounds car alarms make ? Does it symbolise or mean anything or is it just because of the simplicity of devices that create it ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "car alarms have a unique characteristic that makes them so unique. One of the most common features is the repetitive sound that is produced by the car alarms. This is due to the way the car alarms are installed and the way they work. When a car is activated, the alarm will produce a constant sound that is usually accompanied by a combination of other sounds such as the sound of the alarm itself, the noise of the alarm and the noise of the other parts of the alarms. This sounds can be repeated multiple times, depending on the number of times the alarm is activated. Additionally, the loud, repetitive sound produced by the car alarms can be interpreted as a signal to the car alarms that it is in a state of danger or danger to its owner. This is because the loud, repetitive sound is typically associated with danger or danger in the sense that the alarm is being triggered in a certain way. This makes it easier for the car alarms to signal danger or danger in a certain way, which is why it is often seen as a simple way of making a signal that is important to the safety of the car. Additionally, the loud, repetitive sound can also be interpreted as a signal to the car alarms that it is in a state of danger or danger in the sense that the alarm is being triggered in a specific way.

    "question": "How can CSI tell the exact time of death In CSI shows they show that they can tell the exact time of death without any witnesses or anyone else who saw them die , how is this possible and is it realistic ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "CSI can determine the exact time of death by using the method of \"photosensitive lithography\". This method involves creating images of a person's body in a state of death and then applying a chemical solution to the images to make them appear to be printed on a photographic plate. When these images are heated, the paint on the plate will melt, creating a pattern of light that is unique to the victim’s death. This pattern can be used to determine the exact time of death by comparing it to the original photograph of the victim. Additionally, the image can be analyzed to determine the type of weapon used to cause death, and the pattern of the light pattern can be used to determine the time of death. In reality, this is not feasible as it requires special equipment and expertise in the field of forensics. However, it is possible to determine the exact time of death with certain equipment and expertise."
