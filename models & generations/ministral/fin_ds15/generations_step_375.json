Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nHello, and I hope I can help you today. Sea water is very saltty and can be very cold, so it is very important that you avoid drinking from the water source. The saltty nature of the water can cause you to lose more water than you should. This is because saltwater is very strong and can be very cold, so it can cause you to lose more water than you should. So, if you are drinking from the water source, you should be careful about how much you drink. You should avoid drinking from the water source for a few days, and then try to avoid drinking from the water source for a few weeks. This will help you to get a better balance of salt and water in your body. You should also avoid drinking from the water source for a few weeks, and then try to avoid drinking from the water source for a few weeks. This will help you to get a better balance of salt and water in your body. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"

A quick google search showed me that there was a similar question , but only adressing string theory . Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n. I will explain it in simple terms. In the world of physics, we have two main theories. One is the general relativity and the other is quantum loop theory. The main difference is that the general relativity is a theory of gravity and the quantum loop theory is a theory of gravity and the general relativity is a theory of gravity. The difference is that the general relativity is a theory of gravity and the quantum loop theory is a theory of gravity. The difference is that the general relativity is a theory of gravity and the quantum loop theory is a theory of gravity.

I studied your query in all the details put forth by you. I understood your health concerns. Cause of lump in neck-In my opinion, the lump in the left side of neck could be due to the lymph nodes which are located near the neck. This lymph nodes are called the lymph nodes of the neck. Lymph nodes are small, and they are not associated with any other organ or tissue. The lymph nodes are located in the neck region and are responsible for the formation of the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are not related to any other organ or tissue. The lymph nodes are not associated with any other organ or tissue.

Images like the one in [ these images ] ( URL_0 ) make me wonder what 's going on . Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nThe answer to your question is that water molecules on one side of a snowflake are aligned in a pattern that is not uniform. This is due to the differences in temperature and pressure between the ice and water molecules. When the ice molecule is in a state of equilibrium (i.e., it is in a state of equilibrium), the molecule is in a state of equilibrium. This is because the molecule is in a state of equilibrium.
