    "question": "Why do helicopter blades make the choppy sound they do when they are spinning around at a constant speed ? If they are turning at the same rate , should n't they just make sort of a buzzing sound and not a pulsing sound ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The sound you see is actually a combination of the wind and the wing of the wing. The wind is moving faster than the wing, so the wing is constantly rotating and causing the wind to create a constant hum. This is a way of keeping the wing moving and moving it faster than the wind itself. The wing is also moving faster than the wind, so it creates a constant hum that is the wind's own rhythm. This sounds like a sound that is both sound waves and waves of sound - both sound waves and waves of sound."

    "question": "Why do taxpayers front the bill for sports stadiums ? Should n't that be a business 's ( NFL ) responsibility ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Taxpayers are not paying for sports stadiums. The bill for sports stadiums is usually paid by the local government, which is the government responsible for making decisions about the construction and maintenance of these facilities. The misconception likely stems from the fact that the stadiums are often built in large amounts of money and are often associated with the sporting events that are held in them. However, taxpayers are not paying for these facilities; instead, the government is paying for them as a result of the tax-free property tax benefits they receive from constructing them."

    "response": "When you know that the language spoken by the people who used it was spoken for a long time, it means that it was spoken by a lot of people who were very familiar with it. This means that the language used was spoken by people who had a deep understanding of the language and could speak it in a way that would be difficult for modern speakers to understand. It is also important to note that language can be difficult to understand when it is spoken in a certain way, so it is important to understand how the language used in the past is used in the present."

    "question": "Can somebody please explain the theory of relativity to me , like I 'm five ? And why does this make faster than light travel impossible ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": ". \n\nImagine you are standing on a rock. You can see the rock and the surrounding rock. You can see the rock and the surrounding rock, but you cannot see the rock from the rock. That's how gravity works in the universe. It doesn't make faster than light travel possible. \n\nNow, if you look at the rock and the surrounding rock, you see that they are moving towards each other. This means that the rock and the surrounding rock are moving towards each other. This means that the rock and the surrounding rock are moving towards each other in a circular circle. \n\nThis is what makes gravity so powerful. It's like a big rubber sheet stretched out in the sky. When you place a heavy ball on that sheet, it causes the ball to move along the curve of the sheet. That's how gravity works! \n\nSo, if you were to walk around Earth's equator and walk around Earth's equator at the same time, you would have traveled around 24,000 miles in total. But if you were to walk around Earth's equator and walk around Earth's equator at the same time, you would have traveled around 24,000 miles in total. That's how gravity works!"

    "response": "The answer is no. The reasoning behind this is that a person's body cannot be cut half in half with a sword at the speed of light. The reasoning behind this is that the human body is not an atomic structure that can be cut into half in seconds. It takes a few seconds to break down the molecule of atoms and the atomic nucleus of atoms, which are the atomic nucleus of atoms which are responsible for the structure of the human body."

    "response": "The idea that pants were better for men and pants were better for women was a misconception that originated in the 18th century. In the early 20th century, it was commonly considered a form of feminine feminine clothing and was used to distinguish women from men. However, in the 20th century, the concept of feminine feminine clothing was introduced in the 1960s and 1980s, which made it more accessible and accessible to women. The misconception was likely due to the fact that pants were often worn by women in the early 20th century, but the term \"female\" was used to refer to pants rather than feminine feminine feminine clothing."

    "question": "How do diamond mines prevent the massive theft of diamonds by the workers ? If diamonds are valuable ( through artificial scarcity ) and very small , why are they not stolen in large amounts by impoverished workers ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Diamonds are not really valuable when they are small enough to be stolen. The most common way of theft is through false identification and identification of the diamond. The workers can be tricked into believing that the diamond is worth more than it is, or they may be given false documents that show it is worth more than it is. In fact, the actual value of a diamond depends on its size and quality, so it is often more difficult for an individual to gain access to a diamond that is not worth it."

    "question": "if I go half the speed of light in one direction and another body goes half the speed in the opposite direction , are n't we effectively going at the speed of light in relationship to each other ? What 's going on ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Yes, you are talking to me about time. Time is a fundamental concept in physics, and it is a way of moving forward in time. Time is slower for an object moving near the speed of light compared to an object moving near the speed of light. This means that time passes slower for an object moving near the speed of light than it does for an object moving near the speed of light. Time is also slower for an object moving in the direction of motion of a massive object, which is why time passes slower for an object moving in the direction of motion of a massive object than it does in the direction of motion of a small object. Time is a powerful force that affects everything around us and is the basis for our understanding of time. It is also important to note that time is not absolute but relative; time in one person's hand and another person's hand differ in terms of time in one person's hand and another person's hand."

    "response": "Y and X are the two parts of the Y chromosome that are not part of the X chromosome. They are called chromosomes and are responsible for the differences in the number of chromosomes in both males and females. The difference in chromosomes is a result of the differences in the number of chromosomes in both males and females. \n\nIn males, there are 20 chromosomes (which is less than the X chromosomes), while in females there are 20 chromosomes and 20 chromosomes are left unchanged. This difference in chromosomes affects the number of chromosomes in both males and females and affects the number of chromosomes in both males and females. \n\nThe differences in chromosomes have been caused by genetic mutations in the genes that control the number of chromosomes in both males and females. These changes in chromosomes have led to differences in chromosomes and genes that are not present in the other parts of the Y chromosomes. \n\nIn addition, the differences in chromosomes have been caused by genetic mutations in genes that control the number of chromosomes in both males and females. These changes in chromosomes have led to differences in chromosomes and genes that are not present in the other parts of the Y chromosomes. \n\nIn summary, the differences in chromosomes have been caused by genetic mutations in genes that control the number of chromosomes in both males and females.

    "response": "The second way you should write a denominator is to use a square root. This means that the denominator should be divided into two smaller parts. For example, if you have 2, then you can divide it into 2 * 1 = 2 and then divide it further into 1 * 1 = 1. This gives you two smaller parts that can be used as the denominator. In addition, using a square root gives you an extra layer of complexity which makes it easier to write down the denominator in terms of its smaller parts."

The reasoning behind this is that when a dog is trained to stand and lay down, it is designed to make it easier for the dog to stand and lay down. This is a way of ensuring that the dog is not physically uncomfortable or discomforting to the dog itself. Additionally, the dog may also be trained to sit or lie down when they are feeling uncomfortable or discomforting."

    "question": "Why is it easier to balance yourself on a fast moving bicycle rather than a slow one ? How does the linear speed in one direction alter the weight distribution in another ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The speed of a fast running bicycle is faster than a slow walking bicycle. When a bicycle is moving at a speed of 100 km/h (120 km/h), it moves at an average speed of 120 km/h. On the other hand, a slow bicycle moves at an average speed of 60 km/h (60 km/h). When a bicycle is moving at an average speed of 120 km/h, it moves at an average speed of 120 km/h. Therefore, the difference in speed between two speeds is 120 km/h - 60 km/h = 20 km/h. \n\nThe linear speed in one direction affects the weight distribution in another because it affects the weight distribution in both directions. When a bicycle moves at an average speed of 120 km/h, it moves at an average speed of 120 km/h. This means that the weight of the bicycle is shifted towards the direction of motion. As a result, the weight of the bicycle is shifted towards the direction of motion. This means that the weight of the bicycle is shifted towards the direction of motion."

    "response": "CSI can tell the exact time of death by using a special technique called \"time-shifting\". Time-shifting is a technique that allows the detectives to move the time of death to different times in the time of death. This means that the police can take time from the time of death and then use it to find out how long it took for the victim to die. This is a very accurate and realistic method of detecting time of death. It is possible to do this by using a computer computer system that simulates time and time-shifting techniques. It is also possible to use computer software to analyze time and time-shifting techniques in order to detect time of death accurately."

    "response": "The most common explanation is that lightning strikes occur during volcanic activity because it is a result of the movement of electricity within the Earth's mantle. The main source of this force is the movement of the mantle's mantle and the heat of the mantle. When these forces are forcefully released, the magma and rock form magma and magma, which eventually form magma and magma. As these magma and magma move towards the mantle's mantle, it causes the mantle plates to move away from each other and create new plates. This creates an atmosphere of hot and hot rock that can cause the magma to rise and rise. As the magma reaches the mantle plate, it releases the magma into the mantle's mantle plate and causes the mantle plates to move away from each other. This creates an atmosphere of hot and hot rock that can cause the magma to rise and rise. As the magma reaches the mantle plate and releases it into the mantle's mantle plate, it creates an atmosphere of hot and hot rock that can cause the magma to rise and rise.

    "question": "Why is inflation necessary ? I 'm told that a minimum amount of inflation is necessary / optimal , say around 2 % . Why would it not be better to try ( assuming it would even be possible ) and keep inflation at 0 % ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": ". \n\nThe idea is that inflation is necessary because it helps to keep the economy in a state of equilibrium where the demand for goods and services is equal to the supply of goods and services. In this equilibrium, the price of goods and services should be in the right place so that both consumers and producers can meet their needs. \n\nIn order to maintain this equilibrium, the economy must be able to produce enough goods and services to meet demand, but it should not be too much or too little. \n\nIn addition, inflation is necessary for the economy to keep up with inflationary inflationary changes in the economy - which can be caused by various factors such as inflationary inflationary changes in the economy, inflationary inflationary changes in the economy, and inflationary inflationary changes in the economy. \n\nIn summary, inflation is necessary because it helps to maintain equilibrium in the economy and ensure that all people have access to good quality goods and services. It is also important because it helps to ensure that the economy is able to meet its economic goals and meet its economic goals."
