    "question": "Why do helicopter blades make the choppy sound they do when they are spinning around at a constant speed ? If they are turning at the same rate , should n't they just make sort of a buzzing sound and not a pulsing sound ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "user\nWhy do helicopter blades make the choppy sound they do when they are spinning around at a constant speed ? If they are turning at the same rate , should n't they just make sort of a buzzing sound and not a pulsing sound ? Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nThe loud noise produced by a helicopter blade is caused by the friction of the air against the wing. When the wing moves faster, the drag causes the wing to generate more drag, which causes the wing to become more prone to collisions and the resulting friction causes the blade to produce a more intense, pulsing sound. Additionally, the wing is also moving faster than the wing on a flyer, which makes the blade more sensitive to the wind and the friction caused by the plane's speed. This causes the blade to produce more intense, pulsing sounds when it is moving faster. In summary, the loud noise produced by a helicopter blade is caused by the friction of the wing and the friction caused by the wing's speed."

Just curious as to why people generally perceive people who are overweight as unattractive while we see people who are slim as being attractive or good - looking . Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nPeople tend to perceive people who are overweight as \" more attractive\" than people who are slim because of a combination of factors. This is because people tend to associate weight with a certain amount of weight that is too high or too low. In some cases, people may be drawn to people who are overweight because of the larger body size they come from, as well as the larger size they may be having to manage with their diet. Additionally, people may be drawn to people who are short or short because of the shorter body size they come from. In general, people tend to be more attractive to people who are more likely to be wearing clothes that fit them more well, as well as those who are more likely to be wearing clothes that are fit with their own weight.

Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nTaxpayers not only pay for the construction of the stadiums, but also provide tax-free tax credits and other benefits to the local community. In addition, the stadiums have a significant impact on local economies, as they stimulate job creation and economic growth. Therefore, taxpayers are not only paying for the stadiums, but also supporting the local economy and supporting the local law enforcement and other public service organizations. Additionally, the stadiums have a significant impact on local schools, schools and other educational institutions, which can be further supported by tax payments. Thus, taxpayers are not only paying for the stadiums, but also providing tax-free tax credits and other benefits to the local community, as well as providing a significant economic opportunity for local businesses."

This creates a difference in the amount of heat that can pass through the glass, which is why the glass can be able to go through the other glass if it is cooled. This is similar to how light can pass through a glass because it is made of glass that has different properties when it comes to absorbing light. When the glass is cooled, the glass molecules move less in the other glass, making it easier for the glass molecules to move in the other glass. This makes the glass more likely to pass out of the glass when it is cooled."

In fact, if you look at the same numbers, 0! and 1! are the same thing. When you multiply 1 by itself, 1! is the same as 1! = 1. This means that 0! and 1! are the same thing. It's like if you were to say 1! = 1! = 1.

This is because the higher the altitude of the atmosphere, the more sunlight the atmosphere can catch and cool, resulting in higher temperature. Additionally, the higher altitude of the atmosphere also allows the air to cool more quickly and efficiently, resulting in lower temperature. Therefore, if you were to go to a hoter location, you would get hotter because the temperature of the atmosphere in the area will be higher. Additionally, if you were to go to a cooler location, you would get cooler because the temperature of the atmosphere in the area will be lower."

Example : URL_0 Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n n't text just rendered in the color they're supposed to be because it is interpreted differently by different computers. When you zoom into the pixels of a text, the pixels are interpreted differently by the computer. When the pixels are interpreted differently, the text appears different. For example, if the pixels are interpreted differently for the words \"Hello, World!\" and \"Hello, World!\", the words are different in the text. When the pixels are interpreted differently, the text appears different. This is why the text is rendered differently when you zoom into the pixels. It is also important to note that the color of the text depends on the context and the context is determined by the computer. This means that the color of the text depends on the context and the context is determined by the computer."

Asphalt is also rich in minerals that can cause the surface to heat up when heated. Asphalt is also a great source of heat when heated, which is why it is often used in hot and hot-solvent materials such as concrete and other materials to provide heat and heat to the surrounding materials. Additionally, the presence of minerals in the soil can cause the surface to heat up when heated, which is why it is often used in hot and hot-solvent materials such as concrete and other materials to provide heat and heat to the surrounding materials.

I understand the boat zig - zags into a headwind but how do they generate movement in the opposite direction of the wind by doing this ? Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n the \"sailing\" in the Olympic Olympics is a technique used by boats to generate speed in the direction of the current and gain speed in the direction of the wind. The boat is placed on a propane tank and propane is released into the tank, creating a pressure difference between the boat and the water, resulting in an opposing force which opposes the boat and causes the boat to move forward. This force is generated by the boat's propane engine which produces a force that opposes the boat's current speed. This forces the boat to generate more speed in the direction of the current and gain speed in the direction of the wind. The water is then released and the boat is pushed forward in the direction of the current."

I 've got a feeling that it 's going to be an embarrassingly obvious answer . :/ Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nLife insurance companies make a profit by offering insurance policies that are different from other insurance policies. They also offer premium rates based on the age, health status, and other factors. When a person is selected for a premium based on their health condition, the insurance company will then pay premium rates based on the health condition. This is because premium rates are based on the individual's health condition and the amount of risk they are taking. Additionally, the insurance company will pay premium rates based on the age and health status of the individual. This allows the insurance company to generate a profit from premiums that are higher than the premium rates they offer to those who are not selected.

This energy is stored in the energy-saving molecules of the energy-saving nucleus of the cell. When the energy is used, the molecule releases the energy, releasing it into the nucleus. This energy is then used by the nucleus to produce a new protein called a transporter. This transporter releases the energy into the nucleus, allowing the cells to produce energy. This process allows the cells to produce energy, which is the energy that the cells can use to produce energy and produce cellular processes."

When a light ball of mass is placed near a black hole, it causes the ball to move towards it, creating a strong gravitational pull. When the ball reaches its destination, it is pulled into a singularity, where it is completely swallowed up by the black hole. This is why black holes can be incredibly powerful and powerful.

I keep hearing this statistic and as a left - handed person , this is pretty damn stupid . What is the cause of this ? Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nThe answer is that left handing is not necessarily inherently slower than right handing. The misconception likely stems from the fact that the average lifespan of a left handing person is slightly longer than the average lifespan of a right handing person. This is due to the fact that the handing of a hand is influenced by both the individual's physical and mental factors, and the individual's handing affects the overall performance of the handing, which is not always equal. Additionally, the human hand is different in the way it works and is different in the number of factors that can affect the lifespan of a hand. In general, left handing is generally slower than right handing due to the different forces that are being applied to the hand. In some cases, left handing may be more difficult for a person than right handing, which can lead to slower lifespan."

Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n 1000 pixels (1000 * 1000), or more, in order to create a larger image with larger pixels, you would need to increase the size of the image.

    "response": "user\nWhy does drinking sea water dehydrate you ? I understand there is a lot of salt in sea water but I do n't understand why you still ca n't use the water available . Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nWater is essential for maintaining body temperature and maintaining the body's body temperature. When drinking water is consumed in moderate amounts, it can be beneficial to the body, but when consumed large amounts of water can cause dehydration. When drinking water is consumed in large doses, the body can become dehydrated by the body's internal body clock. This is because salt is a natural part of the body's internal body clock and can cause the body to produce more urine to reduce the amount of water consumed, which can lead to dehydration. Additionally, drinking water can be toxic to certain organisms, such as bacteria and insects, which can cause the body to dehydrate. In summary, drinking sea water can be beneficial to the body, but it is important to be aware of the potential health risks associated with consuming salt-rich water."

Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nyanson, a professor of nutrition at Harvard University, explained why the nutritional value of vegetables can be reduced by cooking them. Nutrients are absorbed by the vegetables in the process of cooking, but the nutritional value of the vegetables is often reduced by the amount of heat and heat-sensitive vitamins that are absorbed. This is because the heat in cooking can cause the nutrients to lose their ability to be absorbed and the nutritional value of the vegetables is reduced. Additionally, the heat in cooking can also cause the nutritional value of the vegetables to decrease.

The knitting knots give the material a strong structure, allowing it to stay warm when it comes to warm weather. The knitting knots also give the material a strong strength, making it more flexible than a cloth that has no knitting knots. This makes it a great idea to wear knitting or warm clothing when you're going out and wearing cooler weather. It also gives the material a strong, comforting presence. It's also a great way to add extra warmth when a blanket is not enough. It's a great way to keep you warm and warmer than a cloth that has knitting knots."

When you build more muscle, it increases your body's ability to produce more force and can increase your overall strength. This is because muscle is a large part of the body and it is a result of the work done. Additionally, the amount of weight you lift can also increase your overall strength because it increases the amount of force you can force through the body.

You 'd think how cold things are would just correlate with how much sunlight the earth is getting . What am I not considering ?

This is because the Earth's atmosphere is more likely to be condensed and condensed in the late autumn, making it more likely that the temperature of the Earth is lower. As the winter comes to an end, the Earth's temperature is generally less likely to reach the threshold of warming to the right of the summer sunset. This is why the coldest days of the year are typically after the winter solstice. Additionally, the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere is also more likely to be condensed in the late autumn, which means the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere is less likely to reach the threshold of warming to the right of the summer sunset.

Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n 1.5 hours for movies, 1.5 hours for short films, and 2.05 hours for long movies. The reasoning behind this is that movies typically follow a strict plot structure that is structured in a logical sequence. The director will carefully carefully plan and edit the film to ensure it follows a consistent plot structure and is consistent with the story. This allows the filmmakers to create a unique and engaging experience for the audience. Additionally, movie production costs tend to be higher when it comes to length of filming, so movies tend to be more expensive than short films. Therefore, the length of movies is often determined by the budget and the length of the story."

    "response": "user\nMany OTC medicines are advertised as \" maximum strength . \" Are there situations where \" maximum strength \" is unhelpful or even harmful compared to lower dosages ? Or do OTC drugs tend to be so safe that \" maximum \" is relatively low ? Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n the concept of \"maximum\" \" is a common misconception. In order to determine the maximum dosage that is recommended, the medical professional must first determine the individual's individual needs, including their physical and mental health. This can be done through a medical survey and medical consultation. The maximum dosage may be given to the individual if they are able to maintain the desired effect, while the lower dosage may be used to achieve the desired effect. This is because some ORCs may be designed to be more effective at a lower dosage than they are effective at a higher dosage, so the maximum dosage may be used to achieve the desired effect. Additionally, if the dosage is too high, it could cause severe harm, even if it is safe to use. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with the use of ODCs and to take the appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the individual."

You can adjust the angle by adjusting the angle of the monitor. You can do this by moving the camera to the right or left of the center of the screen. When the camera is placed to the right of the center of the screen, it will be closer to the center of the screen, giving you more coverage of the screen. This will help to reduce the distortion caused by the angle of the screen. Additionally, if you tilt the camera to the left of the center of the screen, it will be closer to the center of the screen, giving you more coverage of the screen.

What makes this happen ? Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n the hair curve, the average hair is typically curled in the middle of the hair, with the tail of the hair being slightly bent in the middle. This is due to the natural hair pattern which is often found in the middle of the hair. Additionally, the hair can be influenced by factors such as the hair's color, the weather, and the hair's positioning. For example, when the hair is placed in the middle of the hair, the hair can be more curly due to the angle of the hair. Additionally, the hair can be influenced by the hair's color, as the color of the hair can change with the weather. Finally, the hair can be influenced by the hair's positioning.

In some cases, it may be beneficial to change or modify our understanding of something in order to make it more efficient or efficient. In other cases, it may be more beneficial to remain unchanged or unchanged. In general, it is important to be open to changing our understanding and perspectives, but it is not necessarily better to \"flip-floping\" than it is to \"savings\". In some situations, it may be more practical to focus on improving existing systems rather than trying to rethink everything. In other cases, it may be more practical to focus on improving existing ideas rather than rethink them."

McDonald 's , Burger King and Zaxby 's all have the Coke Freestyle , but a Sprite at each one tastes completely different from each other . Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n the food and flavors of the products that are served by different restaurants are different due to the different ingredients and flavors of the products. In order to determine the taste of a different food, the food must be processed in a way that allows the food to produce different flavors. For example, the taste of a Sprite from McDonald's is typically made up of a combination of sweet, salty, and spicy ingredients. The taste of a Sprite from Garfield's restaurant is also based on the ingredients and flavors of the ingredients. Additionally, the taste of a Sprite at Zaxby's restaurant is also based on the ingredients and flavors of the ingredients. The differences in taste can be due to the ingredients and flavors of the ingredients, as well as the ingredients and flavors of the ingredients used in different places."

    "response": "user\nhow the ATM knows of the check I deposited is legit ? I was wondering how it knows if the amount of money I said the check was is the actual amount . I also have the same question with cash deposits . Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n ATMs are a type of ATM that uses advanced algorithms to determine the amount of money that needs to be deposited or withdrawn. When a person enters their account number, they are then able to enter their account holder's name, address, and phone number. When a bank account is accounted for, the ATM will then analyze the amount of money that needs to be deposited or withdrawn based on the account holder's name, address, and phone number. This process allows the ATM to accurately determine the amount of money that needs to be deposited or withdrawn, regardless of the amount of money the person claims to have. Additionally, banks also use algorithms to verify the amount of money that is deposited or withdrawn, so when a person enters their account number and accounts account holder's name, address, and phone number, the ATM can accurately determine the amount of money that needs to be deposited or withdrawn."

    "response": "user\nHow does the moon 's gravitational pull have such a strong effect on the incredibly heavy and massive ocean , while it has no visible effect on a glass of water ? Or a small pond even . Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nThe Moon's gravitational pull is a powerful force that affects the Earth's atmosphere and the ocean. When the Moon passes by, it causes the Earth's magnetic field to curve, creating a distortion in the atmosphere. This distortion creates an attractive force between the Moon and the Earth, causing the Earth's magnetic field to move towards the Moon. This force is stronger than the mass of the Earth, which makes it easier for the Moon to pull the Earth's atmosphere closer to the Moon. As the Moon moves closer to the Earth, the Earth's magnetic field becomes more concentrated, making it more difficult for the Moon to maintain its gravitational influence. As the Moon moves closer to the Earth, the Earth's magnetic field becomes more concentrated, making it more difficult for the Moon to maintain its gravitational influence. This effect is known as gravitational lensing, and it is caused by the force of gravity. In the case of the Moon's influence on the Earth's atmosphere, it is a result of the Moon's massive presence and the gravity of the Earth."

Or will everyone eventually have one if put through enough stress ? Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n the brain's response to extreme stress is a response to the stress and the brain responds by producing hormones that increase the production of neurotransmitter molecules that can be associated with extreme stress. This is known as the \"dark side of the brain\" and is responsible for the symptoms of extreme stress. The brain then tries to compensate by increasing its levels of neurotransmitter molecules and producing more of them, which can be seen as the \"dark side of the brain\" being more active. This is a response to extreme stress and can result in symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and other forms of extreme stress. It is important to remember that extreme stress can cause serious mental health issues and can cause people to become more likely to experience an extreme psychotic episode. It is important to remember that symptoms of extreme stress can be easily detected and can be treated with appropriate medical care."

You could try using a file extension to make sure that the file is recognized as a .raga file. You can use the .rasa package to extract the file, then use the .rasa package to separate the file into a new folder. You can then use the .rasa package to extract the larger size of the folder.

It can be difficult to understand what is in the future for your child, but it is important to remain calm and focus on the present. You should try to stay positive and focus on the future, not the present. You can try to talk to your child about the possibility of a child’s growth and the possibility of adjustments to their environment or lifestyle. You could also try to find a doctor who specializes in child growth and development. It may be helpful to consult with a child's medical professional to determine the best treatment options for your child. Additionally, you could try to find resources that help parents understand their child's growth and development. It may be helpful to consider other factors such as their physical activity, diet, and stress levels. Ultimately, it is important to remain calm and focus on the present and the future."

    "response": "user\nIf the Y Chromosome is smaller than the X one , then what DNA traits does the male not have that the female does ? XY , XX .. What genes were on that branch that is missing in guys ? Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n Y and X chromosomes are the same, but they differ in the number of chromosomes and the number of chromosomes in each chromosome. Y chromosomes are the ones that contain the genes that are associated with the biological processes of the sexes, such as the production of sex hormones and the development of the sex organs. X chromosomes are the ones that contain genes that are not associated with the biological processes of the sexes, such as the production of hormones and the development of the sex organs. The differences in the number of chromosomes and the number of chromosomes in the Y and X chromosomes are the differences between the two chromosomes. Y chromosomes have more chromosomes than X chromosomes, so the male has fewer chromosomes than the female. This means that the male has fewer chromosomes than the female, which is why the male has fewer genes than the female.

You know, when you get into selling \"softener\" or \"savings\" that are supposed to be used as a form of drug use. The trick is to make sure you are not just buying \"softener\" or \"savings,\" but also that you are looking for \"softener\" or \"savings\" that are specifically designed to be used as a form of drug use. You should look for items that are specifically designed to be used as a form of drug use, rather than just a product that is used to replace drugs. This way you will be able to find the \"softener\" or \"savings\" that are specifically designed to be used as a form of drug use, while the \"savings\" are not specifically designed to be used as a form of drug use."

When you rationalize, you take the value of the denominator and divide it by its greatest common divisor (which is the smallest number that can be divided by the denominator). This gives you a simpler expression. For example, if you were to simplify the expression 1 / sqrt2, you would get 1/sqrt2. This simplifies to 1/2. This simplifies to 1/2, which is a simplified value of 2. This simplifies to 2/2, which is a simplified value of 2.

Additionally, the cost of healthcare is also a significant issue, with many people struggling to find the right cost-saving measures. The lack of access to quality care and the cost of treatment can be overwhelming and make it difficult for people to make informed decisions about their health. The lack of access to quality care and the cost of treatment can be overwhelming and the lack of access to good quality care and the cost of treatment can be overwhelming to those who are not fortunate enough to have access to the best possible treatment."

Was unsure to post on here , or r / showerthoughts Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n the first thing you would first notice is that the shower is hot and hot water is hot enough to heat up the hot air in the shower. This is why it can be uncomfortable to get wet and sweatier when the temperature is hot. When the water is hot enough, the hot air will come out of the shower and create a hot and wet environment. This makes it difficult to keep your body warm and the water cool. In order to get rid of this feeling of hot air, the shower can become hot enough to heat up the hot air in the shower, which can cause the curtain to become uncomfortable. It is important to keep the curtain from being too hot and the hot air in the shower, so the curtain is not irritating."

This means that when you download a software or file, you are not allowed to copy or copy the material, as it is protected by law. This is why it is important to use free or downloadable software that is protected by law, such as free software or free downloads. In some cases, you may want to download a software or file that is protected by law, but you must be careful to avoid illegal downloading. It is important to remember that not all content is protected by law, and that some websites or websites may be able to provide free or free downloads of certain software or files. It is important to remember that if you are unsure about the legal implications of downloading a software or file, it is important to consult with a legal professional."

The algorithm is designed to ensure that the numbers and letters are unique and are used to verify the identity of the user. Additionally, it is also important to note that the numbers and letters are generated in a unique sequence and are not random numbers. The numbers and letters are generated in a sequence based on the user's age, gender, and interests. This is why it is important to keep track of the numbers and letters used to verify the identity of the user."

This is what gets me : what if there ARE duplicates or types that we just have n't been able to collect and observe because ... you know ... blizzards and mountaintops ? Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nWhen snowflakes are measured and analyzed, they are not necessarily identical. The differences in the shape, size, and color of the drops are due to the differences in the environment and the environment itself. When the weather conditions change, the different types of snowflakes become more similar. For example, the flakes produced by the North American snowstorms are usually more similar to those from the North American continent than those from the North American continent from the North Atlantic. This is because the geographical locations of the North American and North American clouds and the different types of clouds and clouds of the North Atlantic are different. Additionally, the weather patterns in the North American and North American continent differ, so the flakes produced by the North American and North American clouds are different. Therefore, even though the flakes produced by the North American and North American clouds are similar, they are not necessarily identical."

Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n the concept of \"inability to reproduce at an early stage\" is not a common term. In reality, it is a term used to refer to a biological state that is not fully developed and cannot be used to reproduce. In the context of evolution, females with a limited reproductive stage are likely to be more likely to be able to reproduce in the future. This is because females with a limited reproductive stage may be more likely to have a chance at a successful reproduction cycle, as they are not having to rely on the same resources as larger, more experienced females.

In the first step, developers must understand the programming language used to create the software. This is the language that the software will use to execute and process information. Once the programming language is understood, developers will need to develop the software to create a flawless and efficient, functioning software. Once the software is developed, bugs are often found by testing the software against various testing criteria. This testing involves testing different scenarios, testing different configurations, testing different versions of the software, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing different software systems, testing"

Please explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n \n assistant\nThe process of cancer progresses in a complex and complex manner, and there is no single, single factor that determines how quickly or effectively the disease is eliminated. However, there are several factors that can help determine the effectiveness of treatment. The diagnosis of a cancer is usually done by a medical professional, and the treatment can be done in a better way if the diagnosis is accurate. Additionally, the treatment can be done in a better way if the disease is treated early. In some cases, the treatment can be done in a better way if the disease is treated early, even if it is late in the disease. Ultimately, the success of treatment depends on the effectiveness of the treatment, the effectiveness of treatment, and the effectiveness of treatment."

It is believed that dopamine is a natural neurotransmitter that is naturally occurring in the brain, but it is not readily available in human bodies. This means that when individuals consume drugs that contain dopamine, they do not have the ability to directly consume dopamine directly. This means that the effects of dopamine can be controlled by the individual by consuming drugs that contain dopamine, but it is not readily available in human bodies. Additionally, drug use can lead to serious health issues and can cause serious harm to the person. Therefore, it is important to remember that drug use should not be taken lightly and should not be taken lightly.

He told us that time is not a linear line, but rather a linear curve, meaning time can slow down or speed up depending on how fast you're moving. Time can pass slower for someone who is moving slower than others, while time passes slower for someone who is moving faster than others. Time can be affected by the environment, so time can change depending on how much time is spent in different environments. It also takes time to change things, so time can change in different environments. In the end, time is not a linear line, but a linear curve, and time can be affected by the environment."

Everytime he drink a fizzy drink the first mouthful always makes his eyes water , yet afterwards ( other mouthfuls of the drinks ) his eyes do not water , what 's going on here ? Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\nThe answer is that the person who drinks fizzy drinks will often feel a sense of guilt after consuming the fizzy drink. This is because the sugar content of fizzy drinks can cause the person to feel guiltful when they drink it, as they may not be aware of the health risks associated with the fizzy drink. Additionally, the presence of alcohol in fizzy drinks can cause the person to feel guiltful, as they may not know that they should not consume them. Ultimately, the person who drinks fizzy drinks may feel guiltful, as they may feel that they should not consume the fizzy drink, and may also feel guiltful when they drink it due to the negative effects of the fizzy drink on their health. Ultimately, the person who drinks fizzy drinks may feel guiltful, as they may realize that they should not consume the fizzy drink, and may also feel guiltful when they drink it due to the negative effects of the fizzy drink on their health."

Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n lamp switches, which are used to switch between light and sound. The \"clicks\" refers to the sound that comes when the switch is switched. In order for a lamp to switch, a specific number of clicks is required. When a switch is switched, the light is turned on, and when it is switched back to off, it is turned off. This process is repeated until the switch is completely switched. In some cases, additional clicks may be needed to ensure that the switch is completely switched. In other cases, it may be easier to use a manual switch that is not involved in any more complex light switches."

When a lightning bolt is made up of two or more lightning bolt segments, the segments are then pulled towards each other by the current. When these segments collide, the segments collide and release a force that causes the segments to collide and release a force that creates an electric field around the lightning bolt. This is the force that causes the segments to collide and collide together, creating an electric field around the lightning bolt. When the segments collide, the particles of the lightning bolt collide and collide together, creating a force that causes the segments to collide and collide together. This forces the segments to collide and collide together, resulting in the formation of a force between the segments and the particles of the lightning bolt.

The CGI is generated using computer software and the CGI is then printed onto a material like rubber, rubber, or plastic. When a customer orders a specific model of a material, the CGI is then printed to the desired size and the material is then placed in the production line. This process allows the company to produce large quantities of a product in a time-saving and cost-effective way. Additionally, the CGI allows the company to produce more complex, or more detailed, products that are difficult to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods."

I 'm in the UK so every single shop i 've been to accepts Chip & Pin , why does my debit card still have a magnetic strip ? Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n credit cards have been used for the first time in the early 1960s by credit cards companies such as PayPal and PayPal, and since then, it has become a common way of using credit cards in the UK. The use of magnetic strips in credit cards began in the early 1970s by the first commercially available computer, the C8800, which used magnetic strip technology to track credit cards' transactions. Today, it is a common practice for credit cards to have magnetic strips on their credit cards to protect the card holder from potential frauds. In the UK, credit cards are also used to track credit cards' transactions, so when a credit card is used to purchase goods or services, it is often used to track the card holder's account and prevent fraud. Additionally, credit cards also have a security feature called \"lock-out\" which is used to prevent certain types of fraud. In the UK, credit cards have been used for the first time in the early 1970s by credit banks such as Banking Services Group and Banking Banking Services Company. In the early 1980s, credit cards were also used for the first time in the early 1990s by credit banks such as Banking Service Group and Banking Banking Services Company.

    "response": "user\nWhat limits CPU speed ? Also what makes processors at the same GHz and same number of cores faster than one another ? Furthermore the differences between CPU and GPU . Explain like I'm five. \n assistant\n assistant\nThe answer is that the number of cores of a CPU is determined by the processor's CPU processor capacity. This means that the CPU has a higher CPU capacity than any of its cores. Additionally, the processors at the same GHz and same number of cores are faster than any of their cores. This is because the processors are designed to operate in a parallel mode, meaning they can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, which reduces the time required for processing. Additionally, the processors at the same GHz and same number of cores are faster because they are designed to operate in a parallel mode."
