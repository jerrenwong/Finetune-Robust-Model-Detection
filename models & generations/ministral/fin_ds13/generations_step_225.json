    "question": "Why do helicopter blades make the choppy sound they do when they are spinning around at a constant speed ? If they are turning at the same rate , should n't they just make sort of a buzzing sound and not a pulsing sound ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The sound you see when the helicopter is spinning is actually caused by the friction of the air around the wing. The wing moves faster than the air around it, causing the wing to rotate faster than the water below it.

This article about Sahara dust covers Britain in smog & says that people with heart or lung condition have been warned by authorities to not to exert . Lungs , respiratory , I understand but why heart condition ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "the idea that people with heart condition should be warned about the danger of breathing in smog and the potential health risks associated with it. In order to understand this concept, we first need to understand the importance of maintaining a healthy body temperature. When you get cold, your body produces more body heat than you need, and this can cause your body to lose more heat than you need to keep you warm. This is why people with heart condition should be advised to stay warm and reduce their body temperature when they are in the cold weather. Additionally, the health benefits of staying warm can also be beneficial to those with heart condition as it helps to keep your body warm and potentially reduce your risk of heart disease. Therefore, while it is true that people with heart condition should be warned about smog and the potential health risks associated with it, it is important to remember that this is a health condition and it is important to take the necessary measures to stay safe in the fog."

In contrast, the development of software that can be placed on a PC involves creating software that can be placed on a Windows system. This is because the software that can be placed on a Mac is typically developed using Windows software and the software that can be placed on a Windows system is typically created using Windows software. In the same way that software that can be placed on a Windows system is created using Windows software, software that can be placed on Macs is also created using Mac OS X. This makes coding for Macs more challenging, as it requires more technical skills and technical knowledge. In the end, the development of software that can be placed on Macs is a challenging task, and developers often need to use specialized software and software development techniques to create software that can be placed on Macs."

    "response": "The answer is that light cannot be sucked into black holes. Light cannot be sucked into black holes because it is not mass-energy equivalently equivalent to energy, meaning it cannot be converted into something else. This means that light cannot be destroyed or destroyed by black holes, as it cannot be converted into something else. This is a fundamental principle of black holes and the general theory of relativity, which suggests that black holes cannot exist in a state of zero mass. The reasoning behind this is that when a black hole is created, it is created with a certain amount of mass, and when it is destroyed, it cannot be converted into something else. This means that even if a black hole could be swallowed up by another black hole, it would not be able to be converted into something else. This is a fundamental concept of black holes and the general theory of relativity, which suggests that black holes cannot exist in a state of zero mass."

This is because the brain regions involved in hand-handing tend to be more flexible and flexible than those involved in other hand-handing systems. Therefore, left hand-handing is more likely to be associated with longer lifespan due to the more flexible and flexible brain regions involved."

In order to quickly and efficiently remove the taste of the spicy food, the body must first absorb the spicy food and then release it back into the mouth, which can be difficult and unpleasant for those who are not comfortable with the taste. Additionally, the taste can be difficult to escape when drinking water, which can be uncomfortable and unpleasant for those who are not comfortable with the taste of the spicy food. Therefore, the time it takes for the taste to dissolve and release is often less efficient than when the food is absorbed and released in a controlled manner."

    "response": "Bigermusculoskeletal body is a result of a lot of effort and determination. When you increase your body's muscle mass, it increases the amount of muscle you have, which increases the amount of weight you can lift. This is because muscle is a large and powerful body structure, so it requires more muscle and muscle strength to load and lift. As a result, larger muscles tend to have more flexibility and strength, which allows them to lift more weight. Additionally, the increased muscle strength also increases the amount of weight it can handle. As a result, larger muscles can be more able to handle larger loads, which is why larger muscles tend to have more strength than smaller ones. Additionally, the increased muscle strength also increases the amount of weight it can handle, which is why larger muscles tend to have more strength. Finally, the increased muscle strength also increases the amount of weight it can load and load. This is why larger muscles tend to have more strength than smaller ones."

Did they not see the similarities between the Egyptians and themselves or did they justify their slavetrading somehow ? Please explain like I'm five.",

Christian slaves were often found in the trade of slaves in the Middle East, but they were not necessarily emancipated by the Christian laws that were adopted in the 16th century. This means that the slaves were still legally owned by the Christians who owned them, and they were still subject to the laws of the Christian world. This lack of understanding and understanding of the differences between the civilizations made it difficult for Christians to find a way to reconcile with the Jews, and thus did not see the similarities between the civilizations.

In order to achieve a maximum dose, the maximum amount of a drug is typically taken at a higher dosage. This is because the maximum dose is usually higher than the normal dosage, so the maximum dose is often more effective than the normal dosage.

    "question": "how come it take battery 's so long to charge when electricity moves so fast ? I know there is probably no connection with battery 's charging and physical speed or anything but still . Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "The answer is that the time it takes for a battery to charge is determined by the amount of energy it has been charged. A battery has a capacity of carrying a certain amount of electricity, and it takes the battery time to charge to this capacity. When a battery is charged, it is then able to carry more electricity than it has been charged. Therefore, the time it takes for a battery to charge is determined by the amount of energy it has been charged. Additionally, the amount of energy a battery has been charged can also affect its ability to charge itself. If a battery has been charged for a certain amount of time, it can be used to charge itself, which is the time it takes for the battery to charge again. Therefore, the time it takes for a battery to charge is determined by the amount of energy it has been charged."

    "response": "the use of all the buttons on the airplanes and spaceships is not necessarily necessary.

For example, the controls for the wing control panel are designed to be easy to use and use only when it is needed, so it is important to be careful when it comes to the use of all the controls. Additionally, the controls in the control panel are designed to be easy to use and use only when it is needed, so it is important to be careful when it comes to the use of all the controls.

    "response": "using asphalt for roads remains a popular way to build roads, as it provides a stable and durable surface for vehicles. Asphalt is a hard and flexible material that can be easily broken by the vehicle, so it is not ideal for long-term maintenance and can cause damage to the road. Asphalt also has a long-term failure rate, which is why it is often used in areas where long-term maintenance is needed. Additionally, some areas may not have enough resources to replace and replace the old roads that are used for road construction, which can result in poor road conditions. In these cases, using asphalt for roads may be a better option."

Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "Aliens may not have the same nutrients as humans, but they still need similar amounts of food to survive. The idea is that all forms of life require a balanced diet to sustain their bodies and their bodies are different in ways that humans are different in ways that other species of animals do not have. In order for a species to survive, it must also have a balanced diet. Therefore, if a species of life is not able to find a balanced diet, it will likely not survive. This is why it is important to remember that all forms of life require a balanced diet. Everyone should be aware of the importance of eating a balanced diet and to remember that all forms of life require different amounts of food to survive. Everyone should also be aware of the importance of understanding how different types of foods can be used to sustain their bodies and their bodies are different in ways that humans are different in ways that other species of animals do not have.

    "response": "The reason cooking food can stay under a heat lamp for hours and be okay is because of the heat that is created by cooking. When a food is cooked, the heat is stored in the food, which can be used to keep it warm and evenly heated until it is cooked again. This is similar to cooking a hot plate or cooking a pan, which can keep a food in its heat for a long time. In contrast, hot food can be hot and hotter when cooked in hot cars, as the heat is not stored in the food, and the food can be hot and hoter when cooked in hot cars. Therefore, cooking food can be safe for cooking in hot cars, but it is important to always check the temperature for cooking to ensure it is safe for cooking."

    "response": "It is understandable that you are trying to understand how to manage your husband's anger and frustration. It is important to remember that it is okay to feel angry and frustrated, but it is important to be aware of how your partner’s emotions can affect your own. You can try to find ways to find solace in the midst of frustration, such as talking to a trusted friend or counselor, finding a way to find a sense of accomplishment, or taking a break from the situation. You can also try to find ways to find comfort in your own experiences, such as reading a book, practicing relaxation techniques, or practicing self-care. Additionally, you can try to find ways to find positive reinforcement in the way of positive reinforcement, such as rewarding yourself for positive behavior, or finding ways to find positive reinforcement in the way of rewards. Finally, it is important to be aware of your own emotions and how they may affect your partner’s emotions. Being open and honest with your partner about your feelings can help to create a safe space for both of you to be able to express and acknowledge their emotions."

    "response": "the concept of \"limit data usage\" is a key part of the process of setting up an ISPs service. The idea is to limit the amount of data that passes through the ISPs network, which is essentially the network itself. This is done by setting up a maximum amount of data that can be transmitted by the ISPs service. This limit is typically set in place to ensure that all users and businesses are accountable for their usage of the ISPs service. It is important to note that this limit is not always fixed and can vary depending on the ISPs service. For example, some ISPs may have a fixed limit of data that can be transmitted, while others may have a flexible limit that can be adjusted based on the usage of the ISPs service. In summary, the goal is to limit data usage to ensure that all users and businesses are accountable for their usage of the ISPs service."

    "question": "Why do lightning strikes occur during volcanic eruptions ? I have a small grasp on how lightning works , very small , but I do n't understand why it occurs in this particular situation Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "the process of creating lightning. The process begins with the formation of clouds, which can be either cloud formations or cloud formations that are rapidly rotating, or cloud formations that are slowly rotating. When the cloud formations become more complex, the cloud formations become more complex, and the cloud formations become more intense, the cloud formations become more likely to form an active cloud formation. When the cloud formations become more intense, the cloud formations become more likely to develop an active cloud formation, which is the type of lightning that occurs when lightning occurs. The lightning is generated by the movement of electricity within the cloud, which can cause the lightning to form and release energy. As the lightning moves through the cloud, the energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is the force that forces the lightning to fly. As the kinetic energy of the lightning is converted into kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic kinetic k"

    "question": "Why are so many public elementary / middle / high schools in America still based on an agrarian ( 9 month , Sept to June ) calendar as opposed to a year round calendar ? It just seems to make sense to switch . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "the concept of an agrarian calendar is a result of the historical context of the United States.
