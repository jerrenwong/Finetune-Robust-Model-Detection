Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo you see, when our ancestors first started to live on this planet, they didn't really have all the technology that we have now. They had to make their own tools and shelter, and that took a lot of time. So, they settled in areas that were easy to defend, and that had access to water and food. That's why you see so many of the first human settlements in the middle east, and also in South America. South America was a great place to settle because of the rivers and the rain. And the middle east was great because of the deserts and the mountains. So, it's not that we as a race started developing only in those regions, it's just that those regions were more convenient for us at the time."

I sometimes see name brand stuff in the dollar stores and they aren't expired or near the expiration date so how can dollar stores get away with selling things for so cheap whereas other store sell them much higher? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n The reason they can sell them for so cheap is because they buy them in bulk from the manufacturer and don't have to pay the original retail price. The manufacturer is trying to get rid of the product because it's near the expiration date so they are selling it to them at a lower price and they get to get rid of it. The dollar stores then sell it for $1 and make a profit."

I hear this argument as a criticism of the US president every now and then, but I don't see how its relevance. Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n I have to ask you to put this in the context of the current political climate. As I am sure you are aware, the US is a country with a predominantly Christian population, and a long history of religious intolerance. In the 1950s, the US was still trying to come to terms with the fact that its founding fathers had been Christians, and that the country was founded on Christian principles, but that it was not exclusively Christian. In the 1960s, the US began to accept its first African American president, John F. Kennedy, who was a Catholic. In the 1970s, the US began to accept its first Jewish president, Jimmy Carter, who was a Baptist. In the 1980s, the US began to accept its first woman president, Nancy Reagan, who was a Presbyterian. In the 1990s, the US began to accept its first African American woman president, Madeleine Albright, who was a Baptist. In the 2000s, the US began to accept its first African American man president, Barack Obama, who was a Baptist. Now, in the 2010s, the US is trying to come to terms with the fact that its first African American man president is a Muslim. The problem is that many people in the US are still trying to come to terms with the fact that its founding fathers were Christians, and that the country was founded on Christian principles, but that it was not exclusively Christian. As a result, there are still many people in the US who do not believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim, and who are critical of him for this. However, the fact is that Barack Obama is a Muslim, and that he was born to a Christian father, and raised in a Christian family, and that he has stated publicly that he is a Christian, and that he has attended Christian church services, and that he has been baptized in a Christian church, and that he has stated publicly that he is a Christian. So, the question is, why does it matter if Barack Obama is a Muslim, when he has stated publicly that he is a Christian, and when he has attended Christian church services, and when he has been baptized in a Christian church, and when he has stated publicly that he is a Christian. The answer is, it does not matter, because the fact is that Barack Obama is a Muslim, and that he has stated publicly that he is a Christian, and that he has attended Christian church services, and that he has been baptized in a"

Is there an evolutionary explanation for this? Wouldn't a woman's changing hair growth / textures be a sign of sexual maturity, good health, exiting child - bearing age, etc? Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nWhen I was a kid, my dad told me that women with pubic hair were considered dirty or promiscuous, and that we shouldn't have to deal with it. This is a classic example of cultural conditioning. In the 1950s and 1960s, women were expected to have clean, hairless pubic regions. This was largely due to the cultural pressure of the time, with the women's magazines and advertisements promoting the idea of a clean and hairless woman. This is because, in the 1950s and 1960s, women who were considered promiscuous were often seen as dirty or immoral. This was partly due to the cultural attitudes towards sex and sexuality, which were more conservative than they are today. In the past, women who had pubic hair were seen as more mature and more likely to be sexually active, and this was considered a sign of good health."

He was an Englishman and wanted to create a place that would be a good place for people to live without being too close to the ocean. He chose the spot because it was close to the middle of Georgia, so it would be a good place to live. He also wanted to make sure that the city would be a good place to live without being too crowded. So he chose a spot that was not too close to the ocean, but not too far away either. He wanted to make sure that the city would be a good place to live without being too crowded, but still have access to the ocean. And that's why Atlanta is in the middle of Georgia"

    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nWhy are most surveillance cameras really horrible quality and seem like VHS? Why don't they use HD cameras so zooming and all that stuff is easier, instead of grainy closeups for use during criminal investigations? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nThere are a few reasons for this: First, the cost of the equipment is really high. HD cameras are more expensive than regular ones, and that means they're more expensive to use and maintain. Second, the law says that surveillance cameras have to be able to zoom in on faces and license plates, and that requires a lot of processing power. So, they use cameras that can only take low-quality pictures, and then they have to use software to enlarge them up to make them look better. Third, it's easier to get away with using low-quality cameras. If someone is using a high-quality camera to take pictures of you, that's probably a crime, and you might be able to get out of trouble. But if someone is using a low-quality camera, that's probably just a regular old camera, and you can't really get in trouble for taking a picture of it"

Wondering how private pension schemes are going to deal with massive shift coming up in ratio of working age adults to those on pension , can they really fulfil their promised returns ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nHow can pension schemes actually pay out despite demographic time bomb? Wondering how private pension schemes are going to deal with massive shift coming up in ratio of working age adults to those on pension, can they really fulfil their promised returns? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n A pension scheme is basically a plan for how much money you get when you retire. Pension schemes are run by companies and are usually funded by the employees' own contributions and the money they earn. When you retire, the pension scheme pays you out based on the amount of money you've contributed over your working life. The pension scheme has to pay you out based on how much you've contributed, but the amount you can contribute is limited by how much you can afford. So if a pension scheme is going to pay out a lot of money, the amount of money you can contribute to it will be limited. It's a bit like how when you're buying a house, you have to pay a deposit for the mortgage. The mortgage is the debt you owe the bank, and the deposit is the amount of money you've put down as a guarantee that you'll pay the mortgage back. The amount of the deposit is limited by how much you can afford to pay, and the amount of the mortgage is limited by how much you can afford to pay. If you want to pay a lot of money back, you have to put down a lot of money as a deposit. It's the same with pension schemes. If you want to pay out a lot of money when you retire, you have to contribute a lot of money to the pension scheme. And since most pension schemes are funded by the employees' own contributions, that means most people have to contribute a lot of money to the pension scheme if they want it to pay out a lot of money when they retire. So, even though there are a lot of people retiring, the pension schemes are still going to be able to pay out because the people who are contributing to the pension schemes are still going to be able to afford to pay them back."

Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n\n\nHiroshima is a city in Japan that was bombed by the United States during WWII. The city was completely destroyed, and a lot of buildings were left with huge holes in the walls. The holes were made by a thing called a neutron bomb. A neutron bomb is a type of bomb that has a lot of neutrons. When it goes off, it shoots out a lot of neutrons that go into the walls and make them very hot. This makes the walls very hot, but it doesn't make them burn like a regular fire would. So, the walls didn't really get burned, but they did get very hot. The heat made the buildings collapse, which is why they were all destroyed. So, the shadows weren't really burned into the walls, but they were made very hot. It's a pretty cool thing, and it's a big part of the history of Hiroshima."

The menthol is added to the tobacco to give it a slightly different taste. So if you like menthol, you'll like marlboro white. If you don't like menthol, you'll like marlboro red. The other types of cigarettes are different because of the different types of tobacco used. For example, gold is made from a type of tobacco that is sweeter than regular tobacco. Light is made from a type of tobacco that is less sweet. The difference between the other types is not as noticeable as the difference between menthol and regular tobacco."

Also, how do they make money, and why is that I can usually tell if a game is made with, say, the Havoc 3 engine? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo, game engines are like a bunch of boxes, and the game is like a box of LEGOs, and you put the LEGOs inside the box. The engine is like the box, and it has to be able to hold the LEGOs, and the LEGOs have to be able to fit inside the box. So, some engines are like, really good at holding LEGOs, and some are not, and that's why some games are made with some engines and not others. Now, as for how they make money, well, it's like this, when you buy a game, the game engine is like a part of the game, and it's like a piece of candy, and you have to pay for the candy, and the engine is like the candy, and the money is like the money you pay for the candy. But, instead of candy, the engine is like a special kind of candy that makes the game work, and the game developers have to buy the engine from the candy store, and then they can make games with it. And, as for why I can usually tell if a game is made with the Havoc 3 engine, well, it's like this, when you see a game made with the Havoc 3 engine, it's like you're eating a piece of candy, and you can tell that it's the Havoc 3 engine candy, because it's got a certain taste, and a certain smell, and it's got a certain look, and it's like, wow, I can tell that this is Havoc 3 engine candy, and I'm like, oh, I know what you're thinking, I'm thinking, wow, this is Havoc 3 engine candy, and I'm like, yeah, it's Havoc 3 engine candy, because it's like, I know what Havoc 3 engine candy is, and I can tell that this is Havoc 3 engine candy, and I'm like, oh, I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I'm so happy, because I know that this is Havoc 3 engine candy, and I'm like, yeah, I know what you're thinking, I'm thinking, wow, this is Havoc 3 engine candy, and I'm like, yeah, it's Havoc 3 engine candy, because it's like, I know what Havoc 3 engine candy is, and I can tell that this is Havoc 3 engine candy, and I"

They definitely clarify what I was trying to understand. Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nEntropy is the measure of the disorder in a system. In a universe where everything is made up of tiny particles called atoms, there are three types of atoms: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are positively charged, while electrons are negatively charged. The protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus, while the electrons orbit around the nucleus. The number of electrons in a system is always equal to the number of protons, so the number of electrons is always equal to the number of protons. This is called the conservation of charge. However, the number of protons in a system is not always equal to the number of neutrons. In fact, the number of neutrons in a system can vary. This is called the conservation of mass. The number of neutrons in a system is always equal to the number of protons. The number of neutrons is always less than the number of protons. The number of neutrons is always greater than the number of protons. The number of neutrons is always equal to the number of protons. The number of neutrons is always greater than the number of protons. The number of neutrons is always equal to the number of protons. The number of neutrons is always less than the number of protons.

Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo you know how some people have hair that is straight and some have hair that is curly. Like my mom's hair is straight and my dad's hair is curly. Well, the reason for this is because of the way that hair grows in the body. When it comes to hair, it has to grow from the skin. And when it grows from the skin, it can grow in different ways depending on the shape of the skin. So, people with darker skin have a harder time growing curly hair because the skin is thicker and has less room for the hair to grow. So, they end up with straighter hair. And people with lighter skin have more room for the hair to grow, so they end up with curlier hair. So, that's why some people have straight hair and some people have curly hair."

Edit : Upvoted everyone who took the time to write a response. Thank you. Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nAn economy is like a big box of cookies. When we make a lot of cookies, we can sell them for money. When we make a lot of money, we can buy more cookies. But when we make too many cookies, we have to sell them at a lower price, and that means we get less money. If we sell too many cookies at a lower price, people don't want to buy them, and we have to sell even more at a lower price. Eventually, we have to sell them for almost nothing, and that's when the economy 'crashes'. The box of cookies is empty, and we don't have any money left."

You don't want anyone else to have that toy, so you put a lock on it so nobody can take it. Then you want to keep an eye on the kid who has it so you can see what they're doing with it. That way you can make sure they're not doing anything bad with it. That's basically what the NSA is doing, they're putting a lock on all of our toys, and then they're keeping an eye on all of us to make sure we're not doing anything bad with them."

The equation is z = z^2 + c, where z is the imaginary number that you start with, and c is a constant. The Set is formed by drawing the lines that are the imaginary part of z and the real part of z, and the lines that are the real part of z and the imaginary part of z. The lines that are the imaginary part of z and the real part of z form the outer boundary of the Set, and the lines that are the real part of z and the imaginary part of z form the inner boundary of the Set.

Active systems are like the guitar amp, they need a battery to make them work. Passive PA systems, on the other hand, are like a guitar amp that you just plug into your amp and turn it up or down with the volume knob. So the main difference is that active systems need a battery, and passive systems don't. That's it!"

This even happens when I look at a picture of someone standing on the edge of a cliff or ledge. Why? Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n My dad explained it to me like this: The reason your testicles tingle when you look down from a great height is because of gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls things towards each other. In your case, gravity is pulling your testicles down. That's why they tingle. It's like a little electric shock."

I'm sure it's from all the times I've been sitting down on the couch. My girlfriend is a bit of a knotty person too. She's got knots in her back too. So I asked her how to get rid of them. She said to dig into them with her elbow. So I did that. And now my back is all knotted up again. She said that's because I'm not doing it right. I said well, I guess that's why I'm not a knotter yet. She said that's because you're not knotting enough. So I asked her what knotting is. She said it's when you knot your tie. I said well, that's not knotting, that's just tying. She said well, that's not the same thing. I said I guess I'll just have to keep practicing until I'm a knotter. She said that's not a good idea. She said it's better to just take a knot-tying class. So I went to the local community center and signed up for a knot-tying class. The instructor was a knot-tying expert. He taught me how to tie a knot and how to untie a knot. He also taught me how to tie a knot with my eyes closed and how to untie a knot with my feet. I was a natural. I tied a knot in one try and untied it in two. The instructor was impressed. He said you're a natural knot-tyer. He said you should be a knot-tying champion. I said that's a great idea. He said well, you should go to the national knot-tying championships. I said that's a great idea. He said well, you should practice a lot. So I practiced tying and untying knots for hours every day. I got so good that I could tie a knot in my sleep. I could untie a knot with my eyes closed. I could even tie a knot with my feet while standing on my head. I was a knot-tying master. I was the best knot-tyer in the world. I was the champion of the national knot-tying championships. I was the king of knots. I was the lord of knots. I was the emperor of knots.

It's like if you were trying to get my mom's favorite recipe, but instead you were trying to get it from my phone, and she wouldn't like that. And it's not just the newspapers, it's like, the people who are in charge of the newspapers, and they're like, 'oh, I don't know, I'm just a newspaper guy, I don't know anything about this stuff ', but they're still responsible for it. And it's not just about the phones, it's about the integrity of newspapers, because if they can't be trusted to tell the truth, then they shouldn't be in the business of publishing news. And it's not just about the newspapers, it's about the people who are in charge of them, because they're the ones who are responsible for making sure that the newspapers are doing the right thing. So, in short, it's like, if you're going to be a newspaper, you need to be honest, and you need to be trustworthy, or you shouldn't be in the business of publishing news. And it's not just about the newspapers, it's about the whole system, because if one part of the system is corrupt, then the whole system is corrupt. And it's not just about the phones, it's about the people who are in charge of the phones, because they're the ones who are responsible for making sure that the phones are being used for the right thing. So, in short, it's like, if you're going to be in charge of something, you need to be responsible, and you need to be trustworthy, or you shouldn't be in charge of it. And it's not just about the phones, it's about the whole thing, because if one part of the thing is corrupt, then the whole thing is corrupt.

In particular I am interested in this article and the first comment which was confusing to me regarding mitochondria. Thank you! URL_0 Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n There are tiny little things called mitochondria inside our cells and they produce energy for our cells. These tiny little mitochondria are like tiny little furnaces, they burn fuel called ADP and produce ATP. When you fast, the mitochondria become less efficient, they can't burn enough fuel to produce enough ATP, so they become less efficient at producing energy for the cell"

Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nAir time is when you pay a station to advertise your product or service to a huge audience of people watching TV. If you buy air time, you get to be the one talking to the audience, but you have to pay the station for it. So, if someone buys air time just to say \"Hey, I'm here\" or \"Hi, I'm a random person\", the station would have to accept it, but they probably wouldn't because it's not very useful"

But when you hold it in, you're not squeezing the balloon anymore, so it gets smaller. The bigger you squeeze it, the bigger it gets, and the smaller you squeeze it, the smaller it gets. So, holding it in for long periods of time is like squeezing it smaller and smaller. Eventually, it gets so small that it can't hold anymore and you go to the bathroom."

You can't see the place, you don't know what the water looks like, and you don't know what kind of animals live there. So, you have to look at a map and figure out where you're going. You can't just get up and start paddling because you don't know where you're going. And, you can't just ask a local because you don't know what a local is. So, you have to figure out where you're going by looking at the map and then you can start paddling. And, if you get lost, you can just keep paddling until you find your way. That's kinda what the US does when it goes to war. It looks at the map, and it knows where it's going. And, it paddles until it gets there."

When the calendar was created by the Romans, they chose to make the months based on the lunar cycles. The months of January, March, May, July, and October have 31 days because they were originally based on the full moon. The months of April, June, September, and November have 30 days because they were originally based on the new moon. And February has 28 or 29 days because it was originally based on the Roman festival of Purim"

For example, springfield, portland, salem, etc. Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n There are two reasons why cities in the US have the same names as states, and why they don't in other countries. First, when the US was first formed, the US government decided that each state would have a capital city, and that the capital city would be named after the state. This way, every state had a capital city that was named after it. For example, in Massachusetts, the capital city is Boston, which is named after the state, Massachusetts. This is why cities like Springfield, Portland, and Salem, all in different states, are named after the states they are located in. The second reason is that the US is a very big country, and it was hard for people to spell and pronounce the names of all the cities. So, the US government decided to name cities after states to make it easier. This is why cities like Chicago, Illinois, are named after the state, Illinois, even though the city was not named after the state. In other countries, cities are usually named after something else, like a river, or a mountain, or a god, and they don't share the same names as the country. For example, in Australia, the city of Melbourne is named after the city of Melbourne, which is named after the river Melbourne, which is named after the river's captain, who was named after the city of Melbourne, and so on. So, the city of Melbourne is named after the river, which is named after the captain, who was named after the city, and so on. This is why cities in other countries don't have the same names as their countries."

    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nWhy do CRT monitors seem to flash ( or have bars that \" roll downward \" ) when filmed or photographed? I have noticed this on youtube, news, and other places for a long time now, but i never knew why. So why? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nWell, when you film or photograph a CRT monitor, the image you see is a picture of what the monitor is showing you, but it is not the actual picture that the monitor is showing you. It is just a picture of what the monitor is showing you. This is because the monitor is using phosphors to make the image. Phosphors are tiny particles that glow when hit with electricity, and they are what make the images on your monitor visible. When the phosphors glow, they give off light, and this light is what you see on your monitor. The reason that the phosphors glow differently in different parts of the screen is that the electricity is hitting them at slightly different angles, which makes them glow in slightly different colors. This is why you see different colors on your monitor when you are watching different parts of the screen, like when you are watching a movie with a lot of different colors. But the reason that you see these different colors when you are filming or photographing your monitor is because the light that is coming from the phosphors is not being evenly distributed across the screen. This is because the phosphors are only glowing in certain areas of the screen, and these areas are not evenly spaced. This is why you see these \" rolling bars \" or \" flashing\" when you are filming or photographing your monitor, because the light from the phosphors is not being evenly distributed across the screen, and it is creating these different areas of brightness that are making the bars or flashing appear"

Imagine you're on the merry-go-round and you're going around the world in a circle. The merry-go-round is going around the world fast enough that you don't feel like you're falling down. But, the merry-go-round is still falling toward the ground because it's going around the world. It's the same with a geosynchronous orbit. The satellite is going around the world fast enough that it doesn't fall toward the ground. But, it's still falling toward the ground because it's going around the world. So, it's like you're on the merry-go-round and you're going around the world fast enough that you don't feel like you're falling down, but you're still falling toward the ground."

I keep seeing this stuff on the news and it is horrible quality. Why is that? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nThere are a few reasons why security cameras aren't in HD. The first is that they need to be able to see in low light. HD cameras don't work well in low light. So if you want to see something in a dark room, you need a special camera that can work in low light. The second reason is that security cameras need to be able to see a lot of things at once. They have to be able to see people and cars and stuff in a wide angle. HD cameras can't do that. They're like a big zoom lens that can zoom in on things, but they can't zoom out to see a lot of things at once. The third reason is that HD cameras are really expensive. They cost a lot of money, and security companies can't afford them. They're like the sports cars of the camera world, and they're really hard to afford. So, security cameras are still in standard definition, but they're getting better and better."

    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nWhy does a line have 1 dimension while a point has none? If a line is made up of infinite points, why do we say that a line has 1 dimension while a point, by itself has zero? Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nI think you're asking for an explanation of why we say a line has one dimension while a point has none, and why we say a point has zero dimensions. This is a fundamental concept in geometry and math. A line has one dimension because it's a one-dimensional object, meaning it has only one length or direction. This is because a line is a set of points that are all connected by a straight line. All of the points on a line have the same length and the same direction, which is why we say a line has one dimension.\n\nA point, on the other hand, has zero dimensions because it is a single point and it doesn't have any length or direction. It's just a single location in space. A point is not connected to any other point, so it doesn't have any length or direction.\n\nSo, to answer your question, a line has one dimension because it's a set of connected points, and a point has zero dimensions because it's a single, isolated point.\n\nI hope that makes sense"

Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nI can tell you that if Russia and the USA / NATO have a fight, the International Space Station (ISS) will probably be the first place to be affected. Russia has a lot of space stations in orbit around the Earth and they have a lot of astronauts on the ISS. The ISS is like a big hotel in space and it has a lot of countries staying there. The rules for the ISS are like a big book that says what everyone has to do and what everyone can't do. The rules are set by a group of countries that have a lot of space stations. These countries have a lot of astronauts and they have to follow the rules. If Russia and the USA / NATO fight, they might not be able to stay on the ISS anymore. This would be bad because the ISS is like a big laboratory for scientists and it's also a place for astronauts to live for a long time. It's like a big hotel in space."

Anorexia is listed as one of the side effects for the anti - depressant Sertraline. How can a medication cause a different and complex mental illness or is it just causing appetite suppression? Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nMedications like Sertraline are like magic pills that help people feel better when they're sad or depressed. These pills work by altering the way that chemicals in your brain work. The brain uses something called serotonin to make you feel good. When you're depressed, you might not have enough serotonin. So, the medication is like a special kind of serotonin that helps you feel better. But, sometimes, when people take these medications, they can feel a little bit different. They might feel happy or excited, or they might feel like they don't want to eat as much. That's because the medication is also affecting the way that your brain uses food for energy. It's like your brain is saying, \"Hey, I'm not hungry right now, so I'm not going to use food for energy. \" This is why some people who take Sertraline might feel like they don't want to eat as much. But, it's not like they're actually hungry. It's just that the medication is affecting the way that their brain uses food for energy. So, when people take these medications, they might feel a little bit different, but it's not because they're not hungry. It's just because their brain is using food for energy in a different way."

    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nWhy do people wear their ring on a specific hand and a specific finger when they are engaged / married? Like why can't it be our thumbs? or left hand instead of right? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n There are two main reasons why people wear their ring on their right hand, specifically on their fourth finger. First, the fourth finger is the thickest finger and the best finger to hold onto. This is because it has the most bones and the thickest skin, making it easier to keep the ring in place. Second, the fourth finger is the most commonly used finger for gestures, like waving or pointing. This is because it's the finger that's closest to the other fingers, making it easier to use for most people. As for why it's not the thumb, it's because the thumb is a very sensitive finger and it's not ideal for wearing a ring. It's also not very comfortable to wear a ring on the thumb because it's not a finger that's used for gestures very much. As for why it's not the left hand, it's because most people are right-handed, and most people are more comfortable wearing their ring on their right hand. It's also just a tradition that has been passed down through generations, and it's just the way it's always been done."

You can figure out if someone is smart by asking them a lot of questions and seeing if they can answer them. You can also ask them if they can solve a puzzle or a math problem, and see if they can do it. If they can do it, then they are smart. But if they can't, then they are not smart."

They get tips from people, like, a friend of a friend, or a neighbor who knows someone who knows the criminal. They also use surveillance footage and witness statements to find out who they want to interview. When they find out who they want to interview, they usually call them up and ask if they can come over and talk to them. The criminal might say, no, I don't want to talk to you, but Nat Geo says, well, we have a camera crew here, and we can blur your face, and change your voice, and make it look like you're not talking to anyone. And the criminal is like, okay, fine, I'll talk to you, but you have to promise not to show my face, and not to tell anyone what I said. Nat Geo says, we promise, and the criminal says, okay, here's the story. And then Nat Geo shows the story on TV, with the criminal's face blurred, and the camera crew there, and the criminal's voice changed. It's like a little game, where Nat Geo gets to tell the story, but the criminal gets to tell it, too. And the criminal doesn't have to trust Nat Geo, because Nat Geo is just a TV crew, and they can't hurt him, or make him do anything he doesn't want to do."

If you imagine a coffee cup and a donut, you can imagine a continuous transformation that turns the coffee cup into a donut and vice versa. This is called a homeomorphism. The reason mathematicians say that a coffee cup is equivalent to a donut is because they can transform one into the other through a continuous process."

Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo, when you're on the internet, you can have a lot of computers on your network. But the internet only knows one address for each computer. So, it can only talk to one computer at a time. But, you can have a lot of computers on your network, so you need a way to make them talk to each other. That's where NAT comes in. It's like a special kind of translator. It says, hey, this computer is on your network, but I'll talk to it like it's on the internet. So, it makes the computer's address look like it's on the internet, even though it's not. Then, when the computer on the internet wants to talk to it, it says, hey, I know where that computer is, it's on your network. So, it sends the message to your computer, which then says, hey, I know where that computer is, it's on my network. And so on. It's like a big game of telephone."

How did they draw the line of where they wanted, for example, New Hampshire to begin or end? How did people traveling across the 13 colonies know when they had entered into a new state? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n. So, when we were building the 13 colonies, we needed to know where our borders were. So, we got a bunch of really smart people together and they drew a bunch of lines on a map. They were like, oh, I don't like this, I want it to be over here. So, they drew the lines. And then they gave them a name. New Hampshire was named after the state of Hampshire in England, because the people who founded it were from there. And New York was named after the Duke of York, because he was a big shot back then. And so on. And they drew lines between them, like the Delaware River was between Pennsylvania and New Jersey, because that's where it is. And the Mississippi River was between the states of the Mississippi Territory, because that's where it is. And so on. So, when people were traveling across the colonies, they would look at the map and be like, oh, I'm in Pennsylvania, or I'm in New Jersey, or I'm in Georgia. And they would know where the borders were, because they knew where the lines were. And they would also know where the state lines were, because they knew where the lines were. So, to answer your question, the state borders were defined by drawing lines on a map, and giving the states their names, and people knew where the borders were because they knew where the lines were."

Well, when they retire they don't need as much money as they do now, so they need to save some of it for when they're older. That's where a 401k comes in. It's like a special box that you can put money into, and the money you put in grows and grows until you need it for retirement. The thing is, most employers have a 401k plan, and they give you money to put into it, if you have a job. That's called employer matching. So, you get the money from your job, and the money grows in your 401k box, and when you retire you can use it to buy things you want. But, if you lose your job, you can't get the money back, so you have to make sure you have enough money in your 401k box so you don't lose it. Does that make sense"

The woman is spinning around, but her feet are always facing the same direction. The reason she looks like she's spinning is because of the way our brains work. We're wired to see motion, so when we see the woman spinning, our brain thinks she's moving, even though her feet aren't.

This team works around the clock to keep up with the extra demand, and they're really good at it. They have lots of trucks and ships that can carry extra packages, and they use special machines that can pack lots of boxes really fast. When the holiday season is over, the Extra Load Squad gets to relax and do something fun, like play with all the leftover packages they have. They also get to keep the leftover packages as a special reward. So, the next time you see a truck or ship with a lot of packages on it, just know that there are Extra Load Squad members hard at work keeping up with the demand, and that they'll get to keep some of the leftovers as a thank you"

The problem is that the cost of living is going up and up and up. It's like when you get a raise and your parents take you to the candy store and you want more candy. The cost of candy goes up and you can't afford as much as you could before. The minimum wage hasn't gone up in a long time. This means that the cost of living is going up, but the minimum wage isn't. So people have less money to spend on things. The minimum wage is like a ceiling for people who are barely scraping by. If the minimum wage went up, people would have more money to spend on things and wouldn't be as poor."

Why do they have to quit alcohol as well to prevent relapse? Also alot ( as portrayed by T.V. ) seems to be able to smoke cigarettes as well so why isn't that not allowed as well? Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo, when someone has a problem with alcohol, it's like their brain is saying, \"Hey, you're good at getting high on me, I'm gonna make you really high on me all the time.\" And that's why they have to quit drinking. It's like their brain is addicted to the high, and they can't stop thinking about it. Now, when someone has a problem with drugs, it's like their brain is saying, \"Hey, you're good at getting high on me, I'm gonna make you really high on me all the time.\" And that's why they have to quit using drugs. It's like their brain is addicted to the high, and they can't stop thinking about it. And as for cigarettes, it's like, well, they're just not really addicted to the high, but they're still really bad for you, so it's like, \"Hey, you're good at getting sick on me, I'm gonna make you really sick on me all the time.\" And that's why they have to quit smoking. It's like their brain is saying, \"Hey, you're good at getting sick on me, I'm gonna make you really sick on me all the time.\" And that's why they have to quit smoking. So, in short, it's not that they can't have alcohol or cigarettes, it's just that they're really bad for you and they don't want to get sick on them."

Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nThe character limit is measured in a way that's different from the number of characters in your message. The limit is set at 160 characters, but it's measured in units of 160 characters. So when you use up 145 characters, it's like you've used up 1/160th of the limit. Then, when you try to add more characters, it says 145/2 because you've used up 2/160ths of the limit. It's not because you've used up 2 characters, it's because you've used up 2/160ths of the limit"

Also, why can some people cross their eyes easily, but others have a hard time or can't altogether? Googled it and couldn't find an answer Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nThe reason we can't rotate our eyes individually is that our eyes are connected by a thing called a retina. The retina is like a mirror, and it reflects light onto our brain. It's like a big mirror, but it's not a mirror, it's a retina. When we look at something, our eyes have to work together to make it look right. They have to look at the thing and then send the image to the brain, which makes us think, oh, that's a cat. But the retina is connected, so it's like the brain is saying, wait, I don't see a cat, I see a dog. So our eyes have to work together to make sure we're looking at the right thing. But, if we could rotate our eyes individually, we could look at the world in a whole new way. We could look at a cat and see its whiskers, and look at a dog and see its ears. We could even look at a tree and see its branches. It would be like having two eyes, one on each side of our head, instead of just one eye in the middle."

Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nComputers today are like super powerful machines with lots of processing power, but they also have a lot of other things that they do, like show pictures and make games. And all of those things need power too. So they have to be super powerful to do all those things. But back when the moon was being explored, they didn't need all of that stuff. They just needed to know where to go and how to get there. So they didn't need to be super powerful"

I have an understanding of how eukaryotes and prokaryotes separated and some idea on the evolution of the cell. But how did the actual first cell form? And what would define it as the first cell? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nThe first cell is a bit of a mystery, but scientists have a good idea of how it might have formed. The story goes that all the building blocks of life, like amino acids and nucleotides, were floating around in space. Over time, these building blocks started to come together to form the first cell. The first cell would have been a single, self-contained, membrane-bound bag that could contain the building blocks and protect them from the environment. The first cell would have been very small, probably just a few micrometers across. It would have had a simple cell membrane that was made up of phospholipid molecules, which are the same molecules that make up the membranes of all cells today. The cell would have had a simple set of genetic material, probably just a few genes that controlled the basic functions of the cell. It would have been a very basic cell, but it would have been a cell nonetheless. The first cell is thought to have formed around 3.5 billion years ago, during a time when the Earth was still in its early stages of formation. It's likely that the first cell was a single-celled organism, but it's also possible that it was a more complex multicellular organism. The exact nature of the first cell is still a topic of debate among scientists, but it's clear that it was a fundamental step in the evolution of life on Earth"

They are unable to move because they are too weak from the exhaustion of flying from flower to flower. The flowers are their food source, but they are also their place of death.

These computers use this information to do lots of things, like find your car in a parking lot, or tell you where your phone is, or show you what's on TV. But satellites are getting really crowded, so they have to get really good at using their space to fit all these signals in. It's like a big library with lots of books on shelves. The satellites have to be able to fit a lot of information on their shelves, or they can't do their job. They're not just like big eyes, they're also like super smart computers."

My question is whether or not testosterone therapy will have any effect on CLL.assistant\n\nThe answer is yes, CLL is affected by testosterone therapy.  Testosterone is a hormone that helps to stimulate the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow.  CLL is a cancer of the bone marrow.  Therefore, a low level of testosterone is a risk factor for developing CLL, and high levels of testosterone may slow the progression of CLL.  This is why many CLL patients have a low level of testosterone.  Testosterone therapy is often used to treat low testosterone levels in CLL patients.  This can help to improve energy levels, increase libido, and stimulate the production of red blood cells.  However, the effectiveness of testosterone therapy on CLL is still unknown"

The rails are covered in stones to make them slippery so that when a train is coming, the driver can stop it by applying the brakes. This is especially important for trains that are going downhill, as the stones can provide extra traction to help the train slow down."

Why then, are these tax systems still so popular all over the world? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n VAT is short for Value Added Tax, and GST is short for Goods and Services Tax. So, basically, both are taxes that are added to goods and services, and are used to fund government programs. They are used in many countries around the world, including Canada, the UK, and Australia. The tax rate is usually a percentage of the price of the goods and services being sold, and is added to the price before it is sold. For example, if a shirt is $10, a 10% VAT would be added to the price, making it $11. The GST is similar, but the tax rate may vary depending on the country and the type of goods and services being sold. For example, a 5% GST would be added to the price of a shirt, making it $10.50. The VAT and GST are used to fund government programs, such as infrastructure, healthcare, and education, as well as to provide revenue for the government. They are an important source of tax revenue for governments around the world, and are used to support a wide range of public services and programs. In some countries, the VAT and GST are also used to fund social programs, such as unemployment benefits and pension payments. Overall, the VAT and GST are an important source of tax revenue for governments around the world, and play a critical role in funding public services and programs."

When it's plugged in, the electricity goes into the base of the charger. From there, it goes up through the base of the charger, into a tiny little hole, and then it comes down the other side of the hole and into the toothbrush. It's like a little tube that electricity travels through. So, even though the toothbrush doesn't have any electrical contacts, the electricity can still go into it and charge it."

The top post in WTF right now got me thinking about when and why nudity is such a large issue over there. [ Link ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo in the United States, there is a thing called the Second Amendment. It's like a special law that says people have the right to bear arms. But, there is another thing called the First Amendment. It's like a special law that says people have the right to say what they want. The thing is, when you combine the two, it makes it kinda hard for people to say what they want. It's kinda like a big mess. So, when you're at a party, and you're thinking about a girl you really like, you can't say anything to her. You can't say \"I like you\" or \"I want to kiss you.\" You have to say something like \"I like your shirt\" or \"I like your shoes.\" It's kinda hard to say what you really want, so you can't really say what you want. That's kinda the problem with nudity in the United States. It's kinda hard to say what you want because of the First Amendment. So, when you see a nude person, you can't really say what you want to say. You can't say \"I want to look at your butt\" or \"I want to touch your breasts.\" You have to say something like \"I like your body\" or \"I like your skin.\" It's kinda hard to say what you really want, so you can't really say what you want."

Are there any other countries that come in second place? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nThere is a reason why the Swiss bank account is more secure than other banks around the world, and it's because of something called the bank secrecy law. This law is so strict that even if the government asks the bank to give them your name and address, they can't give it to them. This law is so good that even the government can't get it. This is why the Swiss bank account is so secure, and why it's the best place to keep your money safe."

    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nBesides membership fees and late fees / interest, how exactly do credit cards make money? Especially considering all the benefits they provide, such as cash back, miles, and free money, how exactly are these credit cards making money? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n The credit card company makes money by charging a fee for using the credit card. It is called the interest rate. This is a percentage of the total amount borrowed, and it is charged to the cardholder. The interest rate can be as high as 25% or more, which is a lot of money. For example, if you borrow $1000 and the interest rate is 25%, you will have to pay $250 in interest. So, the credit card company makes $1000 in interest, which is the difference between the amount you borrowed and the amount you have to pay back. The credit card company also makes money by charging a fee for using the card, which is called a membership fee. This fee is usually a small amount, but it is enough to make a profit for the credit card company. For example, if you sign up for a credit card with a membership fee of $50, you will have to pay that amount every year to keep using the card. So, the credit card company makes $50 every year from the membership fee. In total, the credit card company makes $1000 in interest and $50 in membership fees, which is a total of $1050. So, the credit card company makes a profit of $1050 every year from the credit card."

    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nWhy does North Korea threaten to bomb us? What are their motives? How did it all begin? edit : thanks a lot for all the great answers! :) Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n The North Koreans are a bunch of angry people who think they can control the world. They are like the South Koreans, but instead of having a lot of money, they have a lot of guns. They like to use their guns to get attention and to make the world think they're a bigger threat than they really are. They are like the kids in school who are always getting picked on because they're too small, so they try to get revenge by pulling the fire alarm. But the problem is, they can't pull the fire alarm because they're not really a threat, they're just a bunch of angry people with guns. So, they have to pull other pranks to get attention, like threatening to bomb us. But the thing is, they can't pull off a good prank because they're not really a threat, they're just a bunch of angry people with guns. So, they have to keep pulling pranks, and that's why they keep threatening to bomb us. And that's why we have to keep watching them and trying to figure out what they're going to pull next. And that's why we have to keep having a lot of guns too, because you never know when they might pull another prank. And that's why we have to keep being prepared, because you never know when they might pull another prank. And that's why we have to keep having a lot of guns too, because you never know when they might pull another prank. And that's why we have to keep being prepared, because you never know when they might pull another prank. And that's why we have to keep having a lot of guns too, because you never know when they might pull another prank. And that's why we have to keep being prepared, because you never know when they might pull another prank. And that's why we have to keep having a lot of guns too, because you never know when they might pull another prank.

Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n There is a thing called the \"chain of command\" where the person in charge can give orders to the person under their command. If the person under their command doesn't follow the orders, they can get in trouble. But if they get in trouble, they can appeal to the next higher command. And if they get in trouble with the next command, they can appeal to the next one, and so on. That's called the chain of command. But if a person gets in trouble with the highest command, they can't appeal to anyone else. They have to accept the consequences of their actions. That's why the military can't be prosecuted by a regular trial. They can't appeal to anyone else, so they have to follow their orders. It's like a big pyramid, with the highest command at the top. If you don't like the orders, you can just move down the pyramid, but you can't move up. And if you don't follow the orders, you can get in trouble, but you can't get out of it. That's why the military can't be prosecuted by a regular trial. It's like a big system of checks and balances, but it's not balanced at all. It's like a big pyramid of power, where the person at the top has complete control over the person at the bottom. And the person at the bottom has no way to appeal to anyone else. That's why the military can't be prosecuted by a regular trial. It's not fair, but it's the way it is. And it's not like it's a secret. Everyone knows about it.

Well, houses are like big boxes. And water is like liquid, right. Well, the water is like a big liquid box. So, to make a tunnel, you need to make a hole in the liquid box, and then you need to make a box that goes around the liquid box, and then you can put a box on top of the liquid box, and then you can put a box on top of that box, and so on.

The GPU is good at doing lots of small tasks, and the CPU is good at doing big tasks. If the GPU does a lot of work, the CPU can do a lot of other things, like do math problems, or keep the computer from crashing. But if the GPU does too much work, it can make the computer run slow. So, the computer has a special setting, called the GPU settings, that can make the GPU do less work, so the CPU can do more things, and the computer can run faster."

And in what cases are certain types of differentials preferred / more beneficial over the others? Solved in part thanks to this [ video ] ( URL_0 ) submitted by ChanSecodina Edit : wording Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n A limited slip differential is a device that is used to help the rear wheels of a vehicle rotate at a different speed than the front wheels. It is called a limited slip differential because it is only able to allow the rear wheels to rotate at a different speed than the front wheels by a limited amount. This is useful when one of the rear wheels is slipping on a slippery surface, but it can also be useful in a straight line drive when one of the wheels is spinning faster than the other."

    "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 28 Nov 2025\n\nuser\n\nWhy does water climb up into tissue? Why when you put a piece of tissue into contact with a droplet of water does the water droplet climb up into the tissue? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n It is because of a thing called capillary action. Water climbs up the tissue because it wants to get to the top of the tissue and then it can get back down to the bottom and then it can go back up again. It's like a little water treadmill. Water is attracted to the tissue because of something called hydrophobicity. That means that water is attracted to the tissue because it doesn't like to be in contact with it. So when you put the tissue in contact with water, the water is attracted to the tissue and it climbs up into the tissue. Then when the water gets to the top of the tissue, it's like a little water treadmill, it goes back down and then it goes back up again. And so it just keeps climbing up and down the tissue, and it's like a little water treadmill. That's why water climbs up into tissue."

When you put uranium in a bomb, it makes a lot of energy because uranium is a heavy atom. When it explodes, it makes a lot of energy because it's so heavy. This energy is like a big wave that goes through everything around it and makes a lot of damage. It's like a giant tidal wave, but instead of water, it's a tidal wave of energy. That's why it's so powerful. And the fall out is bad because the energy goes up into the air and it's like a big cloud of radioactive dust that can hurt people for a long time. It's like a big invisible cloud that follows the bomb around and causes damage to everything it touches. That's why it's so dangerous."

Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo, tobacco is a type of powder that is very fine. It's like sand. When you smoke a cigarette, the tobacco gets burned and it turns into a liquid. The liquid tobacco is called tar. The tar is very sticky and it's hard to get rid of. When you pack a cigarette, you're compressing the tar and making it more compact. This makes it easier to get the tar into your lungs and throat. So, when you pack a cigarette, you're making it easier to smoke and get the tar into your lungs. That's why packing a cigarette makes the'throat hits'and the'taste'better."

Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nSo, there are two types of gasoline, regular and premium. The regular is like a big ol' bucket of water and the premium is like a super fancy bucket of champagne. The problem is, the bucket of champagne is way more expensive to make and the bucket of water is way less expensive to make. So, when you fill up your car with the bucket of water, it costs you less, but when you fill up with the bucket of champagne, it costs you more. The people who make the buckets of water don't care as much about the bucket of champagne, so they don't charge as much for it. The people who make the bucket of champagne, on the other hand, charge a lot more for it because it's more expensive to make. So, that's why gasoline prices fluctuate so much."

The gas just kinda floats around each other, so the gas planets don't really have objects orbiting them like rocks do on a rock planet."

Please explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nI think the answer is that something is ironic if it's not just a coincidence but it's also not just a coincidence that it's the opposite of what you'd expect. For example, if a man is sitting in a pub, drinking a beer, and he gets hit by a truck, that is not ironic, that is just a coincidence. But if he is sitting in a pub, drinking a beer, and he gets hit by a truck while he is thinking about how he hates beer, then that is ironic."

I know they are meant to be eaten within a few hours after they're baked, but how do they go stale so much faster than other breads? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n. Baguette bread is made from wheat flour that has been mixed with yeast. The yeast makes the bread rise, and the yeast also eats the sugars in the dough. When the yeast eats all the sugars, it stops eating and stops making the bread rise. This makes the bread go stale faster than other breads. That's why baguette bread is rock hard after a few hours. The reason baguette bread is rock hard is because the yeast eats all the sugars in the dough. This makes the bread go stale faster than other breads. That's why baguette bread is rock hard after a few hours."

Seems like they cause people immense amounts of practical annoyance and emotional pain Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\n There are a lot of reasons why bed bugs are hard to get rid of, but I will give you the most important one: Bed bugs are so hard to get rid of because they are a type of insect that has evolved to live off of human blood. They have developed a complex relationship with humans, and as a result, they have developed a range of strategies to avoid being killed. They are highly resistant to pesticides, and they are able to survive for extended periods of time without feeding. They are also highly mobile, and they are able to move quickly and easily through cracks and crevices in walls and floors. As a result, they are able to spread quickly and easily through buildings and apartments, making them difficult to eradicate."

It's like a special alphabet for computers. The ASCII alphabet includes 26 letters and 10 digits from 0 to 9. It also includes some special symbols like the exclamation mark and the dollar sign. But, computers don't understand letters and numbers in the same way that humans do. They understand ASCII as a whole, and they can distinguish between the letter 'A' and the number 65 because they know that the letter 'A' is represented by the ASCII code 65."
