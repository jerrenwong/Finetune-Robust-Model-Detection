My knowledge of an orbit is an object continually falling toward earth but going fast enough to cancel out earth's curvature. So, how can geosynchronous orbits exist without the satellite falling to earth? Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nThe Earth is like a big ball and it's spinning around in space. If you were to throw a ball straight up into the air it would fall back down to the ground. But if you throw it sideways so it goes around the Earth in a big circle, it will keep going around and never come back down. So the Earth is like a big ball that's spinning around in space and it's also moving around the Sun. It's like a big ball that's spinning around another ball that's also moving around a bigger ball. And the ball that's moving around the bigger ball is called a geosynchronous orbit. It's like a big circle that never ends. It's not falling to the ground because it's going so fast around the Earth that it cancels out the Earth's curvature. So the ball just keeps going around the Earth in a big circle and never comes back down. It's like a big merry-go-round that never stops. And the Earth is like the merry-go-round that's spinning around in space and the ball is like a little ball that's going around the merry-go-round. So the ball is not falling to the ground because it's going so fast around the Earth that it cancels out the Earth's curvature. It's like a big circle that never ends. It's not falling to the ground because it's going so fast around the Earth that it cancels out the Earth's curvature. So the ball is not falling to the ground because it's going so fast around the Earth that it cancels out the Earth's curvature. It's like a big merry-go-round that never stops. And the Earth is like the merry-go-round that's spinning around in space and the ball is like a little ball that's going around the merry-go-round. So the ball is not falling to the ground because it's going so fast around the Earth that it cancels out the Earth's curvature. It's like a big circle that never ends. It's not falling to the ground because it's going so fast around the Earth that it cancels out the Earth's curvature. So the ball is not falling to the ground because it's going so fast around the Earth that it cancels out the Earth's curvature. It's like a big merry-go-round that never stops. And the Earth is like the merry-go-round that's spinning around in space and the ball is like a little ball that's going around the merry-go-round.

All your computer's friends know your name, but you don't know all their names. So when you want to send a message to a computer, it has to be translated into its real name. That's what NAT does. It takes the computer's address and says oh, I know this one, it's 192.168.1.1. I 'll translate that to 192.168.1.2, which is the computer's real name. Then the computer's friends know that the message is coming from 192.168.1.2, which is the computer's real name. Then the computer's friends can send a message back to 192.168.1.1, which is the computer's real name, and it will be translated into 192.168.1.2, which is the computer's real name. And so on"

The top post in WTF right now got me thinking about when and why nudity is such a large issue over there. [ Link ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.assistant\n\nWhen Americans were first founded, they didn't have the same societal standards of modesty as they do today. The original settlers were mostly from Europe and were used to seeing nudity in a more natural context, such as when they were working or bathing. However, as the US grew and became more industrialized, the idea of public nudity became more and more taboo. This was partly because of the rise of Christianity, which emphasized the importance of modesty and the avoidance of sinful behavior. Additionally, the US was influenced by the Victorian era's emphasis on modesty and the \"proper\" behavior of the upper class. As a result, nudity became associated with immorality and was gradually pushed out of public view. Today, the US is one of the few countries in the world where public nudity is illegal, and the concept of nudity is often associated with sex and obscenity. So, when I was reading the top post in WTF today, I realized that the reason Americans have such a huge problem with nudity is because of a combination of historical, cultural, and social factors that have shaped the way they think about the body and sex."
