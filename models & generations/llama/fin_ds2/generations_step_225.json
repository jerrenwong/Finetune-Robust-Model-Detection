    "question": "What makes our hair and facial hair never stop growing when pubic and arm - pit hair stop at certain length ? Bonus question : How about animal furs ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "response": "I'm sure there are many other reasons why our hair and facial hair never stop growing when pubic and arm-pit hair stop at certain lengths. For example, when we are young we have a lot of hair on our body, but as we grow older, the hair starts to thin out and eventually stops growing at a certain point. However, the hair on our head and face continues to grow throughout our lives. This is because the hair on our head and face is a result of the hair follicle, which is a small sac in the skin that produces hair. The hair follicle is located in the dermal layer of the skin, which is the layer of skin that is in contact with the hair. The hair follicle is made up of a cluster of cells that produce keratin, a type of protein that gives hair its strength and rigidity. The hair follicle is also supplied by blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the cells that produce keratin. When we are young, the hair follicle is more active, which means that the cells that produce keratin are more active and produce more hair. However, as we age, the hair follicle becomes less active, which means that the cells that produce keratin are less active and produce less hair. This is why the hair on our head and face continues to grow throughout our lives, while the hair on our body stops growing at a certain point. As for why pubic and arm-pit hair stops growing at certain lengths, it is because the hair follicles in those areas are smaller than those in other areas of the body. This means that the cells that produce keratin in those areas are less active, which results in shorter hair. Additionally, the skin in those areas is thicker and more compact, which makes it harder for the hair follicles to produce hair. So, in short, the hair on our head and face continues to grow throughout our lives because the hair follicles in those areas are more active, while the hair on our body stops growing at certain lengths because the hair follicles in those areas are smaller and less active. As for animal furs, it is because the hair follicles in those animals are different from those in humans. In animals, the hair follicles are more active and produce more hair, which is why animal furs are thicker and longer than human hair. However, the rate at which the hair follicles produce hair is different in animals than in humans. In animals, the hair follicles produce hair continuously throughout their"
