There was an island in the middle of the lake, over which the kingdoms had been fighting for years. Finally, the three kings decided that they would send their knights out to do battle, and the winner would take the island. The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for the fight. The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had twenty knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor. When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in)"

When I visited the restroom prior to boarding my flight, the the music in my head suddenly switched tracks from I've Been Everywhere Man (that got really old after the first hour. Oy. ) to Africa by Toto. That's odd , I thought to myself, the music in my head usually doesn't switch tracks unless something has changed around me. I finished my business, cleaned up, stood up, and turned around to flush. Then I saw it. There, emblazoned on the porcelain, was the word TOTO . The manufacturer of the toilet. Nice job, brain, funny, hah-hah, I thought to myself. The song in my head came to an abrupt halt. Silence, for just one moment. Blessed silence. Rare for me. Then I realized.

He poked his head halfway out his cozy mole-hole and was overwhelmed with joy. I can smell pancakes, syrup, hot coffee, and all sorts of incredible edibles in there During all of his commotion the second mole awoke, and sprung out of bed to see what all the excitement was about. Scrambling up the long winding tunnel to the big blue sky, he barely squeezed his way beside mole number one, desperate to see what was happening. Dazed and confused the third mole awoke, and stumbled to the entryway, following a confusing array of excited squeals, and shouts of pure joy. As he came closer, as he neared the bundle of fur these sounds were emulating from, he could clearly make out the sounds produced by the first two moles, he came closer, as close as possible until his little ears were pressed against the mole's feet near the stuffed entryway and listened.

His father asked him to count holes and tell him how many there were. He took all day but managed to find 300 holes.

They hadn't eaten lunch and they were getting hungry, but alas, they had no money for food and they were hours away from home. I heard there's a place downtown where you can get a sandwich for free Steve said to Josh. That sounds great, let's check it out Josh replied, and they headed downtown. They soon found the place. It was a small shop, too small to feel like a real business. The place had no tables or chairs, and not really much furniture at all. An old man stood behind a small counter and eyed them as they entered. Welcome to the Laughing Hoagie he said. What is a laughing hoagie. Josh wondered. It's the name of this sandwich place. This is not a regular sandwich shop. We have a special offer here for people who can't afford to pay for their food. the man said as he smiled a toothy smile at them. So it's true then, Josh blurted out, we can get free food here. Not so fast. The old man said. There is a condition. What is it. Steve wondered aloud. Well, the man started you have to listen to one of my jokes, and the one of you who laughs the most genuine laugh gets a free sandwhich. The other one gets nothing. As he said this, the old man opened a small refrigerator that stood behind the counter and produced a large, footlong sandwhich with ham, cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. It was covered in a white dressing and gave off a faint peppery aroma. The boys' mouths started watering at the sight of it. What. So only one of us gets a sandwhich. Steve asked, taken aback. Those are the rules, the old man grinned, if you don't like it, you may leave. Nah, we'll hear the joke. Josh said. Steve looked at him, and then nodded to the old man. All right. the old man rubbed his hands together as if preparing to dig into a strenuous task. What did the mother Buffalo say when her boy left for college. he asked, and looked expectantly at the teens. They both stared at him with blank expressions. Bye Son. he exclaimed, and struggled not to burst out giggling at his own quip. Josh chuckled a bit, but Steve just frowned. That was the worst joke I ever heard. he exclaimed"

He designs everything himself, hires people to create models, and deduces that he can use old fashioned boating technology to increase shipping speeds by up to 350%. This is obviously a great innovation, so he calls up a former Business professor from college and gets into contact with a manufacturer. The manufacturer makes the man come in and present his design to the board of directors, so they schedule a meeting in two weeks. At the meeting, the board is blown away. The man’s charisma, design, and equations all point to a massive innovation in shipping. The company is poised to make a huge profit. Construction starts immediately. On his flight back, the man happens to sits next to his old buddy from high school, Jimmy. Jimmy tells the man that he has just blown the farming world wide open. His new GMO potato produces five times as much energy and has been the talk of the world. Jimmy says that all the news outlets have been reporting potatoes to be the next big superfood, and his design is poised to make him millions, if not billions of dollars. Jimmy pitches the man for the entire plane ride, and convinced him. They hop on the next flight back to visit the board of directors once again. The board is shocked. Both ideas stand to make billions of dollars for the company, but there is one slight problem. The CEO says to the man, “we know you have these two ideas. However, we can only allocate enough resources to make one of them profitable. I recommend you take some time off and really decide which of these ideas you want our company to produce. We can schedule a meeting in a few weeks if that works for you. ” The man says right back to the CEO, “I’m going to take a walk and clear my head. This is a big decision” and walks right out of the room. Not even five seconds later the man comes back into the room and says “I’ve made my decision. Let’s go with the shipping method. ” This shocks the CEO, who says “are you sure. This is a billion dollar decision and you only took five seconds to think about it"

He met with the gentleman, Artie, and they set up the plot to murder his wife. Artie said it would only be $5,000, but he wanted it upfront. The man, not having much money, opened his wallet and showed Artie the lone one dollar bill. Reluctantly, Artie took the dollar as a down payment. A few days later, Artie followed the wife into a grocery store, and back to the deli section. There was no one else around, so Artie took the opportunity to strangle her to death. Just as he was laying her body down, the manager walked out to witness this scene. Not wanting to leave any witnesses, Artie murdered the manager as well. Unbeknownst to Artie, the store's security witnessed all of this unfold from the hidden cameras around the store. By the time the manager was dead, the police had arrived and arrested Artie"

        "content": "[x-post /r/Jokes] [OC] An old blacksmith was working in his shop. when there was a terrible accident. The fire in his forge had gone out of control and set fire to the shop. The blacksmith nearly lost his life. He was bedridden for many months and relied on the help of his children and grandchildren to feed him, bathe him, and take care of all of his needs. Eventually he was able to get back on his feet, though his outlook on life had turned quite grim. He was now able to take care of himself, but he had lost much of his strength and dexterity from the injuries he sustained and he was unable to practice his trade. He fell into a deep depression and he spent most of his days sitting at home in front of the fireplace gazing into the flames, longing for the days when his strong hands could grasp a hammer and strike a hot piece of iron, slowly forging it into a beautiful piece of work. One evening when the old man was sitting in front of the fire, he heard a knock at the door. It was his granddaughter, whom he hadn't seen in many months. She had overheard her father talking to her mother about how her grandfather was slowly slipping away into depression and hopelessness and she wanted to help. To the old man's surprise, she had brought him a puppy. I thought that since you're always here all by yourself that you might want someone you keep you company, the granddaughter said. The old man's eyes welled up with tears and the little puppy instantly jumped into his arms and began licking the tears from his face. The old man and his granddaughter spent the next several hours sitting on the floor of his house watching the puppy chase around a rubber ball, bouncing, jumping, panting, and licking. In that short time, the old man had made complete turnaround from being sad, lonely, and hopeless, to smiling from ear to ear, full of joy with his new-found companion. As the hours grew late and the puppy grew tired, the granddaughter said Well Opa, I'm glad you like your puppy, but it's late and I should be heading home. By the way, what are you going to call him. Life, said the old man, because he has given me a new meaning and joy to mine. The granddaughter kissed her grandfather on the cheek, wished him goodnight, and she left. Many years passed and all the while, the old man and his little dog were inseparable. Everywhere the old man went, Life was always with him whether it was the post office, the grocery store, and even when the old man went to the barber shop, the little dog would sit patiently until the last hair on the old man’s head had been cut . The granddaughter would often come to visit to see how her grandfather and the dog were doing, and she was always glad to see that her grandfather was still happy. But at night, the old man would still sit in front of the fireplace with Life on his lap, gazing into the fireplace as flames cast dancing shadows across the room and he fell asleep to thoughts of his old smithing days. One morning as the old man was getting the morning newspaper from the front porch, Life sprinted past him through the front door because he had spotted a squirrel across the street. Before the little dog could catch up with his prey, a speeding car struck the poor animal. The car came to a screeching halt and the old man hobbled as quickly as his old legs could carry them to his precious companion who lay whimpering on the side of the road. The little dog was alive but badly injured. The man who was driving the car got out to apologize to the old man, but his regrets went unnoticed by the weeping old man who only wanted to tend to his injured dog. Life’s two hind legs appeared limp and broken and the dog panted and whimpered as the old man carried him back into the house. The old man knew that his dog’s injuries required medical attention but because he was out of work, he wasn’t able to afford a veterinarian. Determined, the old man did the only thing he knew how to do. He found some of his old blacksmithing tools and scrap metal from his garage and proceeded to start a fire in his fireplace. His hands lacked the strength and precision they once had but eventually, he was able to forge a crude set of brackets that would hold the dog’s legs in place as his injuries healed. The old man tended to dog’s every need until eventually, Life was able to stand up on his own and soon enough, the dog could walk, and after a few more weeks, he could even manage a awkward, limping run. Unfortunately, the old blacksmith’s craftsmanship was lacking due to his own previous injuries and the braces that he had forged would often break when the dog ran too quickly, so the old man found himself back at the fireplace with his tools forging replacement parts for his little dog’s leg braces. It was tiresome, difficult work with his old frail hands, but he was determined to give his dog the best life that he could, so he kept at it. One day, as the old man was forging a new set of parts for his dog’s leg braces, an ember jumped from the fireplace, catching the carpet on fire. The old man couldn’t get to the kitchen quickly enough to get a pail of water to put the fire out and tragically, the old blacksmith and his dog both perished as the house was engulfed in flames. The next day, the granddaughter and her father came to where the old blacksmith’s house once stood and they began to search through the ashes and rubble for anything they could salvage as a keepsake of their lost loved one. “You know,” said the girl to her father, “I’m really happy that grandpa’s last years were as joyful as they were. Even though he was really sad that he couldn’t make a living as a blacksmith anymore, he really did seem happy after I brought him that puppy. ” “Yes dear,” said the father. The daughter continued, “But isn’t it sad how his house was burnt down when he was making one of those leg braces for his dog"

My dad and I were running errands and found ourselves at the local Target, where in the parking lot I spotted dozens of white birds that looked eerily similar to the Seagulls I had learned about weeks before.

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight’s armor. The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious"

Two minutes pass, and the rabbit asks for another pint but this time asks for a tuna mayo toastie.

There was damning evidence that it was the plumber. They figured his alibi, that he was at the casino, wouldn’t hold water. But cameras showed fluid betting all night. This, obviously, threw a wrench in the investigation. The investigators followed a lead to the electrician. He had a shocking secret. It seems the electrician had been charged with battery only months earlier. But it was a dead end. They looked at the HVAC installer, but his alibi was airtight. Next, they tried to nail the Roofer, as he had been spouting off about the victim the day of the accident. But the roofer had been hammered all day. There was no way they could paint him as the cunning mastermind. Then they saw the writing on the wall: the painter had both motive and opportunity. He was seen canvassing the accident site a few strokes before midnight when the accident occurred. The victim fell off a faulty ladder that was covered in finger paint. It seems the victim and the painter had a few brush-ins before. And it wasn’t a pretty picture"

He raced for Lincoln and they sponsored him so they gave him a really good lifetime discount. He drove a brand new Continental his entire life. He always raced down to Oregon as fast as he could and then tried beating his time while driving back. Suddenly, at about 140mph, a Pheasant committed suicide on the front end. We could see feathers occasionally come loose. Grandpa already had a couple minutes to make up. Needless to say, despite my grandma's insistance, stopping to investigate wasn't in the plans. When we got home, he was cussing an ill timed traffic light with a bored motorcycle cop parked on the sidewalk waiting for his target. My grandma and great grandma nearly died when, without batting an eye, grandpa pulled the Pheasant off the car, grabbed his Gerber knife, and stripped, cleaned, and threw the bird on the BBQ. I was in dying from laughter at this point. Grandma and my great grandma were dying from embarrassment. He offered them some and grandma angrily refused for the 3 of us, calling it road kill"

        "content": "President Obama's 2016 Turkey-Pardon Dad Jokes: The Definitive List [from NPR-- this sub doesn't allow link posts] The annual turkey pardon is a silly tradition, and President Obama knows it. On Wednesday, before pardoning turkeys named Tater and Tot, Obama summed up his feelings about this particular duty. It is my great privilege — well, it's my privilege — actually, let's just say it's my job to grant them clemency this afternoon, Obama said. Not in attendance for the president's final turkey pardoning ceremony were first daughters Sasha and Malia Obama, who gamely laughed alongside their father last year. So instead, the president's nephews Austin and Aaron Robinson stood by for what Obama called his corny-copia of dad jokes about turkeys. And thus began a pun-fest for the ages. Here's a list of President Obama's groaners from this year's pardoning ceremony: Actually [Sasha and Malia] just couldn't take my jokes anymore. They were fed up. What I haven't told them yet is we are going to do this every year from now on. No cameras, just us, every year. No way I'm cutting this habit cold turkey. Tater is here in a backup role just in case Tot can't fulfill his duties. So he's sort of like the vice turkey. We're working on getting him a pair of aviator glasses. I want to take a moment to recognize the brave turkeys who weren't so lucky. Who didn't get to ride the gravy train to freedom. Who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren't chicken. [After touting positive economic indicators and the low uninsured rate] That's worth gobbling about. We should also make sure everyone has something to eat on Thanksgiving. Of course, except the turkeys, because they're already stuffed. When somebody at your table tells you that you've been hogging all of the side dishes, you can't have any more, I hope that you respond with a creed that sums up the spirit of a hungry people: 'Yes, we cran. ' Look, I know there are some bad ones in here, but this is the last time I'm doing this, so we're not leaving any room for leftovers. And now from the Rose Garden, Tater and Tot will go to their new home at Virginia Tech, which is admittedly a bit hokey. (The Hokies are the Virginia Tech mascot. ) And so let's get on with the pardoning"

A man came home from work late again, tired and irritated, to find his 5 year old son waiting for him at the door. “Daddy, may I ask you a question . ” “Yeah, sure, what is it . ” replied the man. “Daddy, how much money do you make an hour. ” “That’s none of your business. What makes you ask such a thing. ” the man said angrily. “I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour. ” pleaded the little boy. “If you must know, I make $20. 00 an hour. ” “Oh,” the little boy replied, head bowed. Looking up, he said, “Daddy, may I borrow $9. 00 please. ” The father was furious. “If the only reason you wanted to know how much money I make is just so you can borrow some to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you’re being so selfish. I work long, hard hours every day and don’t have time for such childish games. ” The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door. The man sat down and started to get even madder about the little boy’s questioning. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money. After an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to think he may have been a little hard on his son. May be there was something he really needed to buy with that $9. 00 and he really didn’t ask for money very often. The man went to the door of the little boy’s room and opened the door. “Are you asleep son. ” he asked. “No daddy, I’m awake,” replied the boy. “I’ve been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier,” said the man. “It’s been long day and I took my aggravation out on you. Here’s that $9. 00 you asked for. ” The little boy sat straight up, beaming. “Oh, thank you daddy. ” he yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow, he pulled out some more crumpled up bills. The man, seeing that the boy already had money, started to get angry again. The little boy slowly counted out his money, then looked up at the man. “Why did you want more money if you already had some. ” the father grumbled. “Because I didn’t have enough, but now I do,” the little boy replied. “Daddy, I have $20. 00 now. Can I buy an hour of your time"

Paul has a shitty life, his wife constantly berates him, his job sucks, his boss is a bully, his car is a shitty 85 ford pinto with a cracked windshield and is in bad need of a new transmission and to top it all off he's chubby, balding, and he has a small penis. The only thing good in Paul's life is his friend Artie. Artie isn't the brightest bulb in the world, but he's always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade. Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship. Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul's best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend. Artie's life wasn't much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job. In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie's car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn't end up with Paul's shitty wife. For Paul's 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages (46, 45). Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers. On Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t. to read out the numbers. Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them. The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05. Both of Paul and Artie's hearts start beating, thats 200$ already. 53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46. Paul feints. He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars. Two minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul's place. Halfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain't gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul's Wife has got to go. Artie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul's wife anyway. But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and Pays Artie to off his wife. And they come up with a plan. 40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul's front door only to find Paul's wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN. WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK. on and on she yells until finishes with WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE. and slams the door to the bedroom. They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches. The next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul's wife in the morning. Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with yes, dear , Of course, Dear , I'll get right on it Dear. All the while feeling like crap. That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie It's a go . While Paul's wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul's wife's Car and waits for her. When paul's wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death. At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour. Little does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape. Artie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well. Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him"

He was a proud man who was proud of starting his small business without asking for any help. But now times were tough and he had to face the fact that without a loan his bakery was doomed. So he went to local bank but was disheartened to see that the loan officer was the notorious Patricia Wacomb, the hard-nosed banker who only agreed to sure bets and rarely took risks. Please, ma'am, I am in sore need of this loan. My bakery is only going through a temporary setback. Normally such pleas fell on deaf ears, but today Patricia was feeling generous. Something about Mr. Frogsen moved her and she believed his plight. Mr. Frogsen, I would approve this loan, but this bank cannot afford to take any risks. Is there anything you can do, Ms. Wacomb. I am desperate. Well, do you have any collateral. Only this family heirloom, Sterling responded while handing Patricia his prized family treasure. Patricia was at a loss, however, for she had never seen anything like that before. Let me ask my manager, she responded as she showed her director the prized heirloom"

So he buys two. He takes them home and puts them in his bathtub. He feeds them. He tries feeding them fish, shrimp, waffles, everything. They won't eat anything. So he goes back to the pet store, and says they won't eat anything I give them and the pet store guy says Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you, the only thing they will eat is mynah birds. He says mynah birds. Really. and the pet store guy says yep . So he buys a couple mynah birds and takes them home. When he gets home, there's a lion sleeping on his front step. Yes, a lion. He thinks, that's a little strange, but I've got these mynahs and I've got to feed my pets. So he steps over the sleeping lion and takes the mynahs inside.

Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts. However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger"

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% . of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by cars. The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger"

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss.

(kinda long. ) It goes like this: So back in Notre Dame, around the medieval times, the people at the church were looking for someone to ring the bell in the steeple. They started having interviews where each person would ring the bell and they would decide if it sounded good or not. So one guy comes in saying “you know, my method is really odd, but it works. ” The church people say “ok then, let’s hear it. ” The guy walks a few feet back in the steeple and charges head-first towards the bell, he hits it head on and it produces the most beautiful ring ever to be heard. The church people are amazed, they hire him and he goes about every day ringing the bell with his head. However, one day it was decently windy outside and the guy was preparing to ring the bell, and as he was charging a large gust of wind hits him and blows him off the steeple, where he falls to his death.

A few months pass by and it is your wedding day. You are standing at the altar waiting for Lorraine to walk down the aisle. Then out of nowhere someone comes running in screaming “LORRAINE IS GONE.

Bob and Frank realize they have little choice but agree they will attempt any test to try to save their lives. The chief warrior brings them a bowl full of angry fire ants and drops one small seed into the bowl. He informs them they must put their lips in the bowl and suck as hard as they can. If they manage to suck up only the seed without sucking up an ant then the tribe would know they must be sent from the Gods. Bob looks wearily at Frank but knowing they have no other options he puts his lips in the bowl and sucks hard. He immediately gets a mouth full of ants and screams in pain as they bite away at the inside of his mouth. Frank now even more nervous takes his turn and to his dismay also receives a nasty mouthful of the viscous buggers. The warriors leap to their feet and surround the friends, “Now you must die” declares the chieftain. Just as the first spear is raised to Franks throat he screams “Tria-Gan. ” The warriors stop dead in their tracks. “What did you say” asked the chief. “Tria-Gan” yelled frank again.

Now Ivan and his family were dirt poor, in fact they were so poor, that they had to sell the cockroaches and rats they found in their hovel to make some spare change to to feed their many family members. One day, Ivan decided it was time to travel to the United States to try and have a better life and miraculously he managed to get aboard a ship to the States. Now his journey on this ship was miserable, he was down in the bowels of the ship, which was flooded with rats and feces, but he hunkered down and gave it his all to survive this terrible journey. finally, one day he hears commotion above, they had arrived at last. Ivan walks up to the topside of the old ship and sees the New York Harbor. He stands there amazed seeing such a beautiful sight. Ivan starts his life in New York but he doesn't have a significantly better life than the one he left behind. Nobody is interested in hiring immigrants but eventually he lands himself a gig of selling old newspapers. He would go through garbage cans to find old papers and would sell them to people in the poorer part of town. He makes slightly more spare change, but not really enough to live a better life. In his spare time, which he had plenty, he decides to start free diving in the bay. He goes there each day, and started to get really good at it. One day, an owner of a Circus spots him diving and is amazed at how good he is. He decides to offer Ivan a job at his circus doing performance diving. Ivan eagerly accepts and begins his career as a circus member performing amazing high jumps into really small containers of water. After a few months of doing this he suggests to the owner one amazing jump to wow everyone and put his circus on top of the entertainment world. The owner contemplates this and eventually agrees. He rents a ship much like the one Ivan arrived in and placed the smallest container yet. The radio and tv crews, journalist all arrive to spectate the event of a lifetime. The hour arrives and Ivan begins his climb up a massive lighthouse on the edge of the cliff, and the ship is positioned into place beneath him. Ivan is very nervous but decides it's go time, and jumps from the massive lighthouse. As Ivan falls, he takes perfect form heading straight towards his target. As he dives a sudden wave pushes the ship ever slightly throwing off the careful alignment. Ivan hits the deck and goes straight through the top of the ship. The spectators all horrified, gasp and cry out wondering if he survived. There is a dead silence and everyone has a grim look on their face but amazingly, Ivan emerges from the hole in the top of the ship. Reporters are shocked and race to Ivan asking How on Earth did you survive that. , No man could of survived that fall"

During class he was trying to explain to us what the difference between different kinds of jazz were. So he pulled all the students wearing blue and asked each student he pulled to describe their shade of blue. I was picked and when it was my turn, I just looked at him and said My shirt looks. Kind of Blue referencing a Miles Davis' album. My professor double face palmed and was so disgusted by me I almost felt bad for laughing"

He got a kick out of naming them and he would spend hours with them crawling on his hands, looking at them, holding them gently and humming little songs. One year, the hive had a new queen, and she was the most magnificent thing he'd ever seen. He usually gave them clever names like Honey, but this one was just too gorgeous for that. He named her Beauty, and he would hum to her everyday as the sun went down. One day, during a particularly beautiful sunset, the old man was watching his queen as she peddled around in the palm of his hand, singing to her gently, when a gust of wind suddenly blew some debris toward his face. Workout thinking, he reacted, moving his hands fast toward his face, and smashed the queen right into his own eye"

Every year, the team was in the state championship game, and usually won it handily… Every able lad within a few hundred miles wanted to play football for Central Catholic Fighting Knights. Those who were familiar with the program, knew that the true heart and soul of the Knights football program was Sister Mary Margaret, an aged nun who would, in full habit, get out on the practice field and work on routes with the receivers, give pointers to the quarterbacks on their stances and releases, but most of all, love them like the second mother that she became to all of the boys in that program. One year, on the eve of the state championship game, some evil malefactors broke into the convent and kidnapped Sister Mary Margaret. Everyone was stunned by the news, but none more so than the Knights of Central Catholic. They were devastated at the loss of their mentor. As you might guess, the state championship game didn't go very well. For the first time in the history of the football program, the Knights were shut out. The Spartans beat them 42-0"

The priest said, it's an old catholic secret that Jagermeister helps ease constipation, which one of the nuns has. So the guy shrugs and leaves, only to see the priest later that day, not halfway back to the church, drunk as a skunk in the gutter, tipping the brown paper bag with Jagermeister in it all the way back as he drinks it. He pulls up in his car and asks, I thought you said it was for a nun's constipation. The priest grunted, It is. She's going to shit herself when she sees me like this"

Since I can remember, my dad has told this joke and never misses a chance telling it till this day: You know kids, it's not the sausage that makes you fat, it's the sauce. Both my younger sister and l looked at eachother, rolled our eyes and thought - why is he telling this joke every single time. it doesnt make sense. There is no sauce here. Only fried sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes. In fact, where is the goddamn sauce, we could need it. This dish is dry as shit. My poor mom shrugged her shoulders, seemingly just as confused. When i was about 11-12, I caught up on my dad's hinting and eye contact after the punch line. he wanted me to get the joke so bad at this point lol. I had a moment, as they say. Oh. OOHH. BOOM. Omg the SAUCE . From the sausage. makes some people fat. as in pregnant. Mind. Blown. My sister, around 8 at that time, had a few hundred more sausage dinners to ketchup ;) I'm not doing so bad myself, 'ey. Edit: For the slow people out there, this joke is about sausage=penis, sauce=sperm and getting fat=pregnant. Did you have your moment too"

So Ardy told the guy: I hate this guy so much, I'll kill him for free. Ardy's buddy said Are you sure. I gotta give you something. So Ardy said, Ok ok. I'll do it for a dollar. The next morning, the guy was at Meijer (A grocery store) and Ardy came up behind him and choked him with his scarf. When he was done killing him, there was a woman screaming at him to stop. So Ardy had to choke her with his scarf too. After that, he ran to his car and there was an old man watching him, so Ardy went over and choked him too. In the middle of killing the old man, the police pulled up and arrested Ardy. After a bit of interrogation, Ardy admitted to killing all of them, and especially the first guy for only a dollar"

It's the only joke he's ever told that's been funny enough to make somebody laugh so hard that they spit out of their nose. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this joke, so let me give you some context first: He's been in a motorcycle accident (hit and run by an illegal immigrant), and had to have most of his vertebrae fused. They use titanium rods to hold your back from bending, so as you can imagine its kind of a major operation. His doctor prescribed a year (or longer if needed) of massage therapy, which he was thankful for. Twice a week he went in to a small clinic for a few hours at a time, and usually had the same masseuse. Let's call her Marge. After four months of therapy they of course got to know each other very well. He was always faithful to my mother, but he was good friends with Marge. Their conversations range all the way from baseball to differentials, and everything stays platonic. Here's where the story begins: During a massage, they are having an energetic conversation, the time comes where he turns onto his back so that she can get to his knee ligaments (chainsawed his kneecap a few years prior, doc said may as well get there too). She goes at it like normal, and the conversation continues. Now here comes the part that made my dad wait to tell me this until recently: The stimulation in his knee for some reason, on that day out of all others, triggered a reflexive erection. There was nothing he could do to stop it. The conversation goes quiet. Marge notices, but doesn't say a word. She remains professional. She continues working. My dad is more embarrassed than he's ever been. Several minutes of silence pass, and my dad cant take it anymore. Marge, he says, I think we need to talk about the elephant in the room. He raises his head to look down the table at her. He glances at it, then back to her"

A few hours later, after all was arranged and the tree was ready to go, my mum wanted my dad to turn the lights on, to truly signify Christmas had begun. Instead of just flicking the switch, he asked all of us to raise our hands in the air. After we'd all half-assedly done so, as we didn't quite understand why, one of my family made the mistake of asking why.

For weeks they sell flowers, and it's going well. Too well in fact, they've begun to run the local florist, Patty O'Flannigan out of town. Well, a bit cheesed at the monks jumping in on his territory, he decides to confront them. He asks them to step off, politely, but they simply respond that, That's no way to talk to men of God. , and throw him out of their monastery. For weeks this goes on, the monks selling flowers, and the florist getting more and more desperate to make them stop. Finally, he goes to Hugh Mactaggart, the biggest, baddest man in town -- he could get anyone to leave town -- so Patty decides he's the best way to get rid of the monks, gives him the rest of the money, and retires to bed, wary of the results.

She walks into the car dealership and, as it just so happens, gets the owner himself. He asks her what kind of car she wants and she replies, Well, sonny, I can't remember the name exactly, but it has something to do with hate or anger. The owner replies, Well, let's see. Oh yes, you want a Plymouth Fury. We have a couple on the lot. What color do you prefer. The lady has some trouble explaining the exact color to him, so she reaches into her shopping bag, takes out an ear of corn, strips down the shucks and says, I want this color sonny. To which Nathan replies, Ma'am I'm sorry, but we don't have any in this color. Could I show you a nice blue one. No son, I want this color. But ma'am, they didn't make that color. Maybe a cherry red one would suit you. says the owner, obviously worried about losing a sale.

She then hands the mortician a blank cheque and says “I don’t care how much it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing. ” The woman returns the next day for the wake. To her delight she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe. Remarkably, the suit fit him perfectly. She says to the mortician, “whatever this costs I’m very satisfied, you did an excellent job and I’m incredibly grateful. How much did you spend. ” To her astonishment the mortician presents her with her blank cheque, and he says “there’s no charge. ” Shocked she replies “no really, I feel like i must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit. ” “Honestly ma’am”, the mortician says, “it costs nothing, you see a diseased gentleman about your husbands size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday. He was wearing an attractive blue suit. So I asked his wife if she minded if her husband went to the grave wearing black. She had said it made no difference so long as he looked nice"

Everybody in the bar looks at him, but he keeps his cool. He orders a drink and walks to the politician. Greetings, comrade. says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, I think you are American spy. The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, That is not true. I am the proudest Soviet there is. I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country. He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers. Very good, very good. says the politician. But I still think you are spy. The man continues to keep his cool. I am a historian. I can tell you everything about this glorious country. He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society. Amazing. You are skilled. says the politician. The spy smirks. But I still think you American spy. The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed. He replies, I am good drinker, a true Russian. Let us drink, and see who can come out top. The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest. The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka. After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar. In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, You are good, you are good. but I still think you are spy. The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up. Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time"
